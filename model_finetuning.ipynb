However, the awesome threat of a major nuclear war involving North America remains a factor in plans for the \\ndefence of Canada.  \\nThe nature and scale of a possible nuclear attack on North America, and the extent to which Canada would be involved in such an attack, \\ncannot be predicted with accuracy. Our major centres would be at some risk of deliberate attack, random explosions could occur, and there \\nwould be the certainty of the danger from widespread, radioactive fallout over most of the Country.  \\nGovernments at all levels have made, and are continuing to make, preparations which will reduce the number of casualties, safeguard \\nsurvivors and contribute to the capacity of this nation to survive and recover from such a tragedy. The purpose of this booklet is to assist \\nindividuals and families in making personal survival plans and preparations to guard themselves against the potential dangers of nuclear \\nwar. \\nMany of the precautions which are recommended will serve a double purpose in that they will save lives in peacetime disasters such as \\nflood, tornado, fire, hurricane, blizzard, ice storm or earthquake. Attention has been directed to this important feature throughout the \\nvarious steps. \\nAll Canadians are urged to read \"11 Steps to Survival\" with care to act on the advice it contains and to keep it handy for emergencies. \\nAlthough protected by Crown Copyright, the contents may be reproduced in whole or in part provided proper acknowledgment of the \\nsource is made. \\nThe Queen\\'s Printer  \\nOttawa, 1969  \\nCat.

Several seconds may pass after you have seen the light or felt the heat before the \\nblast wave reaches you, depending on the distance you are from the explosion. It is like the time between seeing the flash of lightning and \\nhearing the sound of thunder. For example, at ten miles from the centre of an explosion, it would take about 35 seconds for the blast wave \\nto reach you. If caught in the open during a nuclear explosion, this time can be used to find some protection from the blast wave.  \\nYou might be injured by being thrown about by the blast; therefore, keep low. The greatest danger is from flying glass, bricks and other \\ndebris. The blast from a 5-megaton explosion could injure people as far away as 15 miles.  \\n  \\nThe kinds of damage that the blast can do to buildings are:  \\nl\\nComplete destruction of all buildings three miles from the centre of the explosion.  \\nl\\nDamage beyond repair to buildings three to five miles distant. They would have to be torn down.  \\nl\\nMajor repairs required to buildings five to 10 miles distant before they could be occupied.  \\nl\\nLight to moderate damage to buildings 10 to 15 miles distant.

The force of the explosion may make a \\ncrater up to a mile wide and to a depth of one hundred feet. Millions of tons of pulverized earth, stones, buildings and other materials are \\ndrawn up into the fireball and become radioactive. Some of the heavier particles spill out around the point of explosion. The rest are sucked \\nup into the mushroom cloud.  \\nThis radioactive material is then carried by winds until it settles to earth. This is called \"Fallout\". Under some circumstances you may see \\nthe fallout; under others you may not.  \\nThe radioactivity it gives off cannot be seen. You can\\'t feel it. You can\\'t smell it.  \\nBut fallout doesn\\'t come out of the sky like a gas and seep into everything. It can best be described as a fine to coarse sand carried by the \\nwinds. Because the wind direction varies at different heights above the ground, it is not possible to judge from the ground where the fallout \\nwill settle. It can settle in irregular patterns hundreds of miles from the explosion.  \\nThe fallout from a 5-megaton explosion could affect seriously an area of 7,000 square miles. If nothing were done to gain protection during \\nthe period of high radioactivity, there would be a grave danger to life in that area.  \\nBecause fallout is carried so far and covers such a large area, it could be the greatest danger to the largest number of Canadians in a \\nnuclear war. If Canada was not hit by nuclear bombs, those exploding in the United States close to our border could result in serious fallout \\nin many parts of Canada.  \\nThere are four things which determine the amount of radiation reaching your body from fallout:  \\n1.\\nThe time that has passed since the explosion.  \\n2.\\nThe length of time you are exposed to fallout.  \\n3.\\nThe distance you are from the fallout.  \\n4.\\nThe shielding between you and the fallout.',\n",

Take a battery-powered radio with you. Broadcast advice and \\ninstruction may help to save your life. If you don't have a portable radio, turn up the volume of your house radio so that it can be heard in \\nyour shelter. If away from home you are forced to take emergency shelter and are near a radio-equipped vehicle, turn up the volume and \\nopen all the vehicle's doors or windows.  \\nThe Canadian Emergency Broadcasting System, a network of all Canadian radio and television stations which will be formed when a \\nnuclear attack on Canada has been detected, will tell you when and how to take emergency protective action against possible attack and \\nshelter against fallout if an attack occurs.\",\n",

You will be advised over the radio. If the advice concerns fallout, you must take cover against the fallout effects. \\n(See Step 4).  \\nRadio broadcasts will identify areas which will be affected by the fallout and give instructions and advice. These might include:  \\nl\\nLocation of nuclear explosions causing local fallout.  \\nl\\nInformation about the parts of the country to be affected by fallout.  \\nl\\nLength of time before fallout is likely to reach specific communities or areas.  \\nl\\nWays to increase fallout protection.  \\nl\\nSupplies to take to your fallout shelter.  \\nl\\nWhether it is safer to stay in your community or area, or to go to other areas.  \\nl\\nAdvice as to which areas are free of danger.  \\nl\\nAdvice on when to leave shelters and for how long as danger from radioactive contamination diminishes.  \\nl\\nRequests for help in rescue operations, such as rescue, firefighting and medical assistance.  \\nl\\nAdvice on conservation of food, water and fuel.  \\nl\\nHow to keep warm when power is off and the weather is cold.  \\nDon't Use The Telephone \\nWhen the sirens sound don't use the telephone. Listen to a radio or television for information. In the event of an Attack Warning telephone \\nlines will be required for official use.  \\nStep 4: Know How to Take Shelter \\nIt is important to provide your family and yourself with a shelter. But what kind of shelter? This is a decision you must make yourself after \\nstudying the problem.  \\nStudy your shelter requirements in the same way that you would study accident or fire insurance. Decide upon the degree of protection you \\nwant for your family and yourself. Shelter is your insurance against something you hope will not happen, but if it does, will give you \\nprotection.  \\nShelters of the type commonly used in Europe during the Second World War would not provide protection against the blast of a nuclear \\nexplosion. They were designed to withstand short shock pressures lasting something like 1/100th of a second. Shelters designed to \\nwithstand the pressures created by a nuclear explosion must be able to stand up to pressures lasting as long as 6 seconds. In addition, \\nthey must be capable of giving the occupants protection against fires outside the shelter as well as against radiation.  \\nThe fallout shelter is designed to give protection against radioactive fallout only. Because most people in Canada probably would not be \\naffected by the blast and heat effects of nuclear explosions, protection against fallout is all that is required by them.  \\nThe type of shelter for good protection depends upon the distance it will be from the explosion.

Here are some tips on how to increase your \\nprotection in a basement. The amount of protection you can build will depend on how much time you have available until fallout arrives.  \\nl\\nYou can improvise a small emergency shelter by using furniture, doors, dressers, work-bench and other materials.  \\nl\\nSelect a corner of your basement, if possible away from windows, in which to build your shelter. Remove inside house doors from \\nhinges to use as a shelter roof over supports. Supports for the improvised roof can be cabinets, chests of drawers, work-bench, or \\nanything which will bear a heavy load. Use the house doors as a roof surface to provide a base for the heavy material you will have \\nto place on it. Bricks, concrete blocks, sand-filled drawers or boxes, books or other dense items on the roof will help reduce \\nradiation penetration. Around the sides and front of your shelter build walls of dense materials to provide vertical shielding. A small \\ncabinet or dirt-filled box as may be used as a crawl-in entrance which can be closed behind you.  \\nl\\nRemember, the heavier or more dense the material around you, the greater the protection.  \\nl\\nBlock basement windows with earth, bricks, concrete blocks, books or even bundles of newspaper. In winter, use packed snow.  \\nl\\nOn the floor above the corner of the you select as your shelter area, pile any heavy objects you may have available, such as \\nfurniture, trunks filled with clothes, dirt-filled boxes, books, newspapers, or earth from outside.  \\nl\\nOutside, against above ground walls of the basement around your shelter area heap earth, sand, bricks, concrete blocks or packed \\nsnow.',\n",

You need to \\nconsider possible safety issues and monitor family health and well-being.  \\nAiding the Injured\\nCheck for injuries.  Do not attempt to move seriously injured persons unless they \\nare in immediate danger of death or further injury.  If you must move an uncon-\\nscious person, ﬁ rst stabilize the neck and back, then call for help immediately.\\n• If the victim is not breathing, carefully position the victim for artiﬁ cial respi-\\nration, clear the airway, and commence mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.\\n• Maintain body temperature with blankets.  Be sure the victim does not be-\\ncome overheated.\\n• Never try to feed liquids to an unconscious person.\\nHealth\\n• Be aware of exhaustion.  Don’t try to do too much at once.

Turn off the main gas valve from the outside, \\nif you can.  Call the gas company from a neighbor’s residence.  If you shut off \\nthe gas supply at the main valve, you will need a professional to turn it back \\non.  Do not smoke or use oil, gas lanterns, candles, or torches for lighting \\ninside a damaged home until you are sure there is no leaking gas or other \\nﬂ ammable materials present.  \\n• Sparks, broken or frayed wires. Check the electrical system unless you are \\nwet, standing in water, or unsure of your safety.  If possible, turn off the elec-\\ntricity at the main fuse box or circuit breaker.  If the situation is unsafe, leave \\nthe building and call for help.  Do not turn on the lights until you are sure \\nthey’re safe to use.

Doing these positive actions can be \\ncomforting.\\nHelping Children Cope \\nwith Disaster \\nDisasters can leave children feeling frightened, confused, and insecure.  Whether a \\nchild has personally experienced trauma, has merely seen the event on television, \\nor has heard it discussed by adults, it is important for parents and teachers to be \\ninformed and ready to help if reactions to stress begin to occur.\\nChildren may respond to disaster by demonstrating fears, sadness, or behavioral \\nproblems.  Younger children may return to earlier behavior patterns, such as bed-\\nwetting, sleep problems, and separation anxiety.  Older children may also display \\nanger, aggression, school problems, or withdrawal.  Some children who have only \\nindirect contact with the disaster but witness it on television may develop distress.\\nWho is at Risk? \\nFor many children, reactions to disasters are brief and represent normal reac-\\ntions to “abnormal events.”  A smaller number of children can be at risk for more \\nenduring psychological distress as a function of three major risk factors:\\n• Direct exposure to the disaster, such as being evacuated, observing injuries \\nor death of others, or experiencing injury along with fearing one’s life is in \\ndanger\\n• Loss/grief: This relates to the death or serious injury of family or friends\\n• On-going stress from the secondary effects of disaster, such as temporarily \\nliving elsewhere, loss of friends and social networks, loss of personal property, \\nparental unemployment, and costs incurred during recovery to return the \\nfamily to pre-disaster life and living conditions. \\nWhat Creates Vulnerabilities in Children?\\nIn most cases, depending on the risk factors above, distressing responses are \\ntemporary.  In the absence of severe threat to life, injury, loss of loved ones, or \\nsecondary problems such as loss of home, moves, etc., symptoms usually dimin-\\nish over time.  For those that were directly exposed to the disaster, reminders of \\nthe disaster such as high winds, smoke, cloudy skies, sirens, or other reminders \\nof the disaster may cause upsetting feelings to return.  Having a prior history of \\nsome type of traumatic event or severe stress may contribute to these feelings.',\n",

              " 'Recovering from Disaster\\n5.0\\nAre You Ready?  \\n187\\nRecovering\\nfrom Disaster\\nChildren’s coping with disaster or emergencies is often tied to the way parents \\ncope. They can detect adults’ fears and sadness.  Parents and adults can make \\ndisasters less traumatic for children by taking steps to manage their own feelings \\nand plans for coping.  Parents are almost always the best source of support for \\nchildren in disasters.  One way to establish a sense of control and to build conﬁ -\\ndence in children before a disaster is to engage and involve them in preparing a \\nfamily disaster plan.  After a disaster, children can contribute to a family recovery \\nplan.   \\nA Child’s Reaction to Disaster by Age \\nBelow are common reactions in children after a disaster or traumatic event.\\nBirth through 2 years.  When children are pre-verbal and experience a trauma, \\nthey do not have the words to describe the event or their feelings.  However, they \\ncan retain memories of particular sights, sounds, or smells.  Infants may react \\nto trauma by being irritable, crying more than usual, or wanting to be held and \\ncuddled.  The biggest inﬂ uence on children of this age is how their parents cope.  \\nAs children get older, their play may involve acting out elements of the traumatic \\nevent that occurred several years in the past and was seemingly forgotten.\\nPreschool—3 through 6 years.  Preschool children often feel helpless and pow-\\nerless in the face of an overwhelming event.  Because of their age and small size, \\nthey lack the ability to protect themselves or others.  As a result, they feel intense \\nfear and insecurity about being separated from caregivers.  Preschoolers cannot \\ngrasp the concept of permanent loss.  They can see consequences as being revers-\\nible or permanent.  In the weeks following a traumatic event, preschoolers’ play \\nactivities may reenact the incident or the disaster over and over again.\\nSchool age—7 through 10 years.  The school-age child has the ability to un-\\nderstand the permanence of loss.  Some children become intensely preoccupied \\nwith the details of a traumatic event and want to talk about it continually.  This \\npreoccupation can interfere with the child’s concentration at school and academ-\\nic performance may decline.  At school, children may hear inaccurate informa-\\ntion from peers.  They may display a wide range of reactions—sadness, general-\\nized fear, or speciﬁ c fears of the disaster happening again, guilt over action or \\ninaction during the disaster, anger that the event was not prevented, or fantasies \\nof playing rescuer.\\nPre-adolescence to adolescence—11 through 18 years.  As children grow \\nolder, they develop a more sophisticated understanding of the disaster event. \\nTheir responses are more similar to adults.  Teenagers may become involved in \\ndangerous, risk-taking behaviors, such as reckless driving, or alcohol or drug \\nuse.  Others can become fearful of leaving home and avoid previous levels of \\nactivities.  Much of adolescence is focused on moving out into the world.  After a \\ntrauma, the view of the world can seem more dangerous and unsafe.  A teenager \\nmay feel overwhelmed by intense emotions and yet feel unable to discuss them \\nwith others.\\nReview\\nSee Section 1: \\nBasic preparedness',\n",
              " 'Recovering from Disaster\\n5.0\\n     Are You Ready?\\n188\\nMeeting the Child’s Emotional Needs\\nChildren’s reactions are inﬂ uenced by the behavior, thoughts, and feelings of \\nadults. Adults should encourage children and adolescents to share their thoughts \\nand feelings about the incident.  Clarify misunderstandings about risk and \\ndanger by listening to children’s concerns and answering questions.  Maintain a \\nsense of calm by validating children’s concerns and perceptions and with discus-\\nsion of concrete plans for safety. \\nListen to what the child is saying.  If a young child is asking questions about the \\nevent, answer them simply without the elaboration needed for an older child or \\nadult.  Some children are comforted by knowing more or less information than \\nothers; decide what level of information your particular child needs.  If a child \\nhas difﬁ culty expressing feelings, allow the child to draw a picture or tell a story \\nof what happened.\\nTry to understand what is causing anxieties and fears.  Be aware that following a \\ndisaster, children are most afraid that:\\n• The event will happen again.\\n• Someone close to them will be killed or injured.\\n• They will be left alone or separated from the family.\\nReassuring Children After a Disaster \\nSuggestions to help reassure children include the following:\\n• Personal contact is reassuring.  Hug and touch your children.\\n• Calmly provide factual information about the recent disaster and current plans \\nfor insuring their safety along with recovery plans.\\n• Encourage your children to talk about their feelings. \\n• Spend extra time with your children such as at bedtime.\\n• Re-establish your daily routine for work, school, play, meals, and rest.\\n• Involve your children by giving them speciﬁ c chores to help them feel they \\nare helping to restore family and community life.\\n• Praise and recognize responsible behavior.\\n• Understand that your children will have a range of reactions to disasters.\\n• Encourage your children to help update your a family disaster plan.\\nIf you have tried to create a reassuring environment by following the steps above, \\nbut your child continues to exhibit stress, if the reactions worsen over time, or \\nif they cause interference with daily behavior at school, at home, or with other \\nrelationships, it may be appropriate to talk to a professional.  You can get profes-\\nsional help from the child’s primary care physician, a mental health provider \\nspecializing in children’s needs, or a member of the clergy.',\n",
              " 'Recovering from Disaster\\n5.0\\nAre You Ready?  \\n189\\nRecovering\\nfrom Disaster\\nMonitor and Limit Your Family’s Exposure to the Media\\nNews coverage related to a disaster may elicit fear and confusion and arouse \\nanxiety in children.  This is particularly true for large-scale disasters or a terror-\\nist event where signiﬁ cant property damage and loss of life has occurred.  Par-\\nticularly for younger children, repeated images of an event may cause them to \\nbelieve the event is recurring over and over.   \\nIf parents allow children to watch television or use the Internet where images \\nor news about the disaster are shown, parents should be with them to encour-\\nage communication and provide explanations. This may also include parent’s \\nmonitoring and appropriately limiting their own exposure to anxiety-provoking \\ninformation. \\nUse Support Networks\\nParents help their children when they take steps to understand and manage \\ntheir own feelings and ways of coping.  They can do this by building and using \\nsocial support systems of family, friends, community organizations and agencies, \\nfaith-based institutions, or other resources that work for that family.  Parents can \\nbuild their own unique social support systems so that in an emergency situation \\nor when a disaster strikes, they can be supported and helped to manage their \\nreactions.  As a result, parents will be more available to their children and better \\nable to support them.  Parents are almost always the best source of support for \\nchildren in difﬁ cult times. But to support their children, parents need to attend \\nto their own needs and have a plan for their own support. \\nPreparing for disaster helps everyone in the family accept the fact that disasters \\ndo happen, and provides an opportunity to identify and collect the resources \\nneeded to meet basic needs after disaster.  Preparation helps; when people feel \\nprepared, they cope better and so do children. \\nHelping Others\\nThe compassion and generosity of the American people is never more evident than \\nafter a disaster.  People want to help.  Here are some general guidelines on helping \\nothers after a disaster:\\n• Volunteer! Check with local organizations or listen to local news reports for \\ninformation about where volunteers are needed.  Note:  Until volunteers are \\nspeciﬁ cally requested, stay away from disaster areas.\\n• Bring your own food, water, and emergency supplies to a disaster area if you \\nare needed there.  This is especially important in cases where a large area has \\nbeen affected and emergency items are in short supply.\\n• Give a check or money order to a recognized disaster relief organization.  \\nThese groups are organized to process checks, purchase what is needed, and \\nget it to the people who need it most.',\n",

PRA invites comments. Send those comments to the author, \\nDoug Smith, at doug@praweb.org) \\n  \\nPurpose \\n  \\nThis document is intended to be a bullet-point resource and reference for persons, \\norganizations, CERT teams, and OEMs interested in developing community \\ncommunications programs that use the Family Radio Service, General Mobile Radio \\nService, Citizens Radio Service, and Multi-Use Radio Service.  \\n  \\nThe Amateur Radio Service is discussed but we refer you to your local Amateur Radio \\nEmergency Service (ARES) and Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service (RACES) \\nCoordinators for assistance and advice. Every OEM should proactively involve itself with \\nthe local ARES and RACES and use these groups as your PRIMARY source of \\nsupplemental communications systems and operators when normal systems collapse or \\nare seriously over loaded. Amateur Radio operators have, for almost a century, provided \\nemergency and disaster communication as part of their FCC licensee mandate in the \\nAmateur FCC Rules and Regulations. \\n  \\nSet Public Expectations',\n",
              " 'People need to know what to expect after a disaster. Setting expectations is the most \\noverlooked aspect of many service related businesses and is no less important in \\nemergency management. It is akin to making sure both parties in an agreement \\nthoroughly understand the mutually agreed upon terms of their contract. When people do \\nnot know what to expect they get angry, lose focus, become impatient, and then anger \\nand pandemonium results. In the case of a disaster, panic prevails over common sense. \\nWe cannot let that happen in our communities. After a disaster CERT Volunteers and \\npublic safety agencies are focused on triage. These entities want to do the most good for \\nthe most people in the shortest amount of time. The public needs to know what to do in \\nthe first seventy-two hours after a major disaster. \\n  \\nLikewise we CANNOT create expectations that are impossible to meet.  There are \\nefforts to declare Family Radio Service Channel one as an emergency channel. The \\nconcept is that any citizen could use a Family Radio Service radio to make a blind call for \\nhelp to a monitoring Amateur radio operator after a disaster event. The proposal claims it \\nis “instant, reliable crisis communications,” but this is far from the truth. Such a plan is \\nunmanageable in its scope, particularly when no neighborhood familiarization or training \\nis even suggested and in fact declared by the major proponent as unnecessary! Despite \\npleas from the Personal Radio Association the backers of this effort still promote this \\ndangerous scheme.  \\n  \\nPlanners need to provide the general public with some idea of the “who, what, when, \\nwhere, why and how” behind the mitigation efforts for the aftermath of a disaster. \\nPlanners need to do this before the disaster and NOT after the disaster! It should be an \\naggressive effort of the utmost importance. One way to accomplish this is to engage the \\npublic in disaster planning at the grass-roots-neighborhood level. (CERT, neighborhood \\nassociations, Neighborhood Watch, local public meetings, REACT, building associations, \\nparks and recreation meetings, public awareness advertising on radio and television etc.)  \\n  \\nThe public must accept a level of a responsibility toward disaster preparation in order to \\nunderstand their role in disaster recovery. Setting expectations means the public learns \\nbasic concepts and can keep those concepts in mind so that clear thinking prevails over \\npanic thinking.  \\n  \\nThere are not enough communications disaster workers to fulfill the needs of the Family \\nRadio Channel One monitoring scheme. The idea completely ignores the pre-planned \\ntypical response to a major disaster in the first twenty-four to seventy-two hours. Setting \\nthe expectation that a rescuer is waiting and listening to a Family Radio might mean that',\n",
              " 'some families will shelter in place after they have been asked by public safety to \\nevacuate! Setting the wrong expectation can crate new disaster victims and new dangers \\nfor rescuers. It is an excellent idea for neighbors to create their own Family Radio \\nNetwork to assist in checking up on each other after a shelter-in-place emergency. An \\nFRS radio and back-up batteries for each family member should be part of every seventy-\\ntwo-hour disaster kit. \\n  \\nThe following are some expectations to take into consideration for a \\ncommunications plan using the various Personal Radio Services. \\n  \\n  \\n1. The Federal Communications Commission Rules and Regulations must be \\nfollowed in every case. Licenses must be obtained where necessary and all users \\nshould be familiar with Part 95 of the FCC Rules as they pertain to GMRS and to \\nthe unlicensed FRS also in Part 95. The same goes for other radio services in use \\nlike Amateur Radio, FCC R&R Part 97, CB Radio Service Part 95, and the \\nBusiness Radio Services in Part 90. Obeying the rules prevents anarchy, \\ndisorganization, and harmful interference. \\n2. Neighbors must plan to be without emergency services for up to seventy-two \\nhours or more after a disaster. (More or less depending on the severity and scope \\nof the event.) Every jurisdiction has a policy regarding the delivery of services \\nafter a disaster. It needs to be explained. People’s expectations must be set. \\n3. Emergency OES/OEM officials need to explain the expected role FRS and GMRS \\n(Personal Radio Services) have in the event of a disaster. What it can and cannot \\ndo and what it is expected to do, how it can be used, how it should not be used. To \\nthis the OEM’s need to know what resources are available: \\na. Are there GMRS repeaters in your community? What the coverage areas? \\nHow many families? Where are the base stations? Are the repeaters \\nconnected to emergency power? Will the owners make the repeaters \\navailable? \\nb. Where are the GMRS licensees in your community? Do they have base \\nstations, repeater capable radios? Are these licensees in isolated \\nneighborhoods? Could they be used to report for CERT back to an OEC \\nafter an emergency? Does the EOC have licensed GMRS operators to man \\na GMRS base station at the EOC? \\n4. Any use of disaster related supplemental two-way radio to relay information to \\npublic safety officials must be planned for and tested ahead of time. There must \\nbe alternate plans e.g. a Plan B. \\n5. Possession and use of an FRS or GMRS two-way radio does not guarantee an \\ninstant and reliable or an immediate and effective response to an individual’s call \\nfor help using that radio. NEVER set the expectation that calling out on a two-way \\nradio will guarantee a response. Unfortunately, since this concept has already',\n",
              " 'been heavily publicized some families may already believe it is a done deal. \\nOEM’s need to reach these families before the next disaster. \\n6. Whenever possible, use cellular or land-line telephones instead of two-way radios. \\nConventional methods of communication (communication systems the public is \\nalready familiar with) should always be the preferred method of communication. \\nIt is recognized that these systems may be down or temporarily unavailable \\nimmediately after a disaster event. It is the time period immediately after the \\nevent and just before these systems are restored that very-local neighborhood two-\\nway radio communication can be of the greatest help in mitigating welfare checks \\nand rescues. \\n7. Two-way radios are primarily for neighbors to communicate with each other \\nduring and after a disaster so that CERT volunteers or others can provide \\nimmediate search and rescue or so neighbors can assist each other. \\n8. Two-way radio users must learn how to use their radios properly. They should \\nknow how to turn it on and off, how to change channels, disable coded squelch \\ntones, adjust the volume, and transmit. \\n9. Emergency aid may not be available to some people whether or not they have a \\nradio. They may be isolated due to impassable conditions, flooding, down power \\nlines, fire, fallen structures, blocked roads, or there may not be public safety or \\nother resources to assist them. \\n10. While it cannot be guaranteed, having a two-way radio may enable appropriate \\nofficials to communicate with persons in isolated areas. \\n11. Emergency management leaders, CERT trainers, and hobby radio operators need \\nto train their neighbors in the use of two-way radios.  \\n12. Persons should be expected to obey emergency management officials and LEAVE \\npotential disaster areas before the event! When you are asked or ordered to leave a \\npotential disaster area LEAVE! If you cannot leave on your own seek assistance \\nbut leave! Do not stick around expecting to use your tiny little FRS radio to call \\nfor help if you find yourself in deep water! \\n13. Since we generally have a very good understanding of what can occur in a natural \\ndisaster in the United States every person should plan accordingly. Offices of \\nOES and OEM have pamphlets and websites persons can visit for disaster \\nplanning information.  \\n14. The laws of physics as those laws relate to radio propagation of UHF radio waves \\napply to the eventual range of a radio in a given circumstance. The laws of sales \\nand marketing do not apply. \\n15. Amateur Radio operators are NOT allowed to transmit on GMRS in an \\nemergency with modified equipment on GMRS. (Or with Part 95 approved \\nequipment.) Amateur Radio operators do NOT have GMRS privileges at any \\ntime. \\n16. The public must understand the procedures and reasons for evacuation and NOT \\nignore evacuation warnings.',\n",
              " 'As you Begin Planning Ask these Questions \\n  \\n1. Who needs to talk to whom and when and for how long does that does that \\ncommunication need to take place? This is going to be determined by how you \\ndeploy personnel. It may often NOT be necessary for personnel to carry radios of \\nany kind.  \\na. Field disaster worker to EOC \\nb. Field disaster worker to disaster worker? \\nc. Field disaster worker to on-scene public safety personnel.  \\n2. How far will you need to communicate? \\n3. Do you need a relay by radio or telephone? \\n4. Who, what, where are your relay resources? \\n5. Is it necessary to deploy citizen volunteers with communications equipment they \\nuse or is it sufficient to relay information through on-scene public safety \\npersonnel? How many people and which people will have radios? (Not every \\nperson in a large apartment building needs a radio.) \\n6. Do you have alternates for your Block Captains? (Or whatever you call your very-\\nlocal neighborhood emergency coordinators.) \\n7. What kind of interference may already exist on FRS and GMRS in my area? \\n8. Can the interference be mitigated? \\n9. What is the likelihood of intentional interference and how will interference be \\ndealt with it if it happens? \\n10. Which radio channels shall we use for our neighborhood? Select based on current \\nuse. Scan the FRS and GMRS channels. Monitor activity. Choose the quietest \\nfrequencies for your area. GMRS repeater output channels may be busy with \\nhigher powered radio stations. Very-local communications should use FRS one-\\nfourteen. \\n11. Are GMRS repeaters available? Where are they? Who is already using them? Can \\nyour neighborhood benefit from using the repeaters? \\n12. Have the licensees of those GMRS repeaters, or have other GMRS licensees been \\nasked to join the neighborhood team? Remember GMRS repeaters are private \\nproperty. While most licensees will be happy to participate as part of a local \\ncommunications plan they are NOT required to do so. AT this FCC database you \\ncan search for GMRS licensees in your zip code: \\nhttp://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/searchGmrs.jsp \\n13. Does your local repeater have a tone for the neighborhood? (CTCSS/DCS) \\n14. How far away are we from the main roads?  \\n15. Will our radios reach from our residences to key neighborhood access points? \\nHave we tested our neighborhood network? \\n16. Can we communicate with other neighborhoods? Do we need to? \\n17. Is there a way to relay requests for help beyond the range of FRS? Beyond the \\nrange of GMRS?',\n",
              " '18. Are there critical services, plants, roads, etc in the neighborhood where we should \\nput someone with a radio? Water pumping plant, club houses, damns, beaches, \\nguard shacks, major intersections etc. \\n19. Are we prepared to direct public safety resources to rescues and medical \\nemergencies after a disaster? How can we use our radios to do this? \\n20. Do we have a GMRS licensee in my neighborhood? Is that licensee part of our \\nplan? \\n21. Do we have an Amateur Radio operator in our neighborhood? Is that Ham part of \\nour plan? \\n22. Does or OEM office know about our group? \\n23. Do our OEM and local public safety officials have a copy of our neighborhood \\ncommunications plan? \\n24. Has our OEM trained us on basic emergency planning? \\n25. Do we have a neighborhood map and local telephone list? Is there an alerting \\ncalling-tree to alert neighbors to take cover? \\n26. Do we have a welfare telephone calling-tree created to check on neighbors on a \\npriority basis! Elderly first! \\n27. Does our OEM have a CERT program? Do we have trained people in our \\nneighborhood? \\n28. Do we have a meeting place for training? Can we arrange one? \\n29. Do we have meetings already scheduled so we can add this topic to the agenda? \\n  \\nSomething to think about: The Escalation of Alternative Communication Need \\n  \\nJust as law enforcement must consider the escalation of force in the apprehension of \\npotentially violent criminal suspects so to does the communications planner consider a \\nsupplemental communication resource escalation methodology for a disaster. \\n  \\n1. Whenever possible, all normal day-to-day communications systems should be \\nused and when alternative or supplemental communications systems are in place \\nthe objective should be to return to normal systems when normal systems are \\nrestored or are adequate for the need. Normal systems are staffed by public safety, \\nmunicipal, county, state or federal personnel. Assumes all landline, cellular and \\npublic safety radio systems are in place and not overwhelmed.  \\n2. When agencies do require supplemental communication they should look first to \\ntheir own public safety mutual aid plans. When those plans are insufficient use the \\ntrained volunteers of the Amateur Radio Service to free up critical public safety \\nresources. Communication relay functions to and from an EOC/OES/OEC from \\ndisaster or other critical locations should be staffed by trained Amateur Radio',\n",
              " 'Operators of the Amateur Radio Emergency Service/Radio Amateur Civil \\nEmergency Service.  \\n3. When there are insufficient Amateur Radio resources or there are isolated \\nneighborhoods with no resident Amateur Radio operator consider licensing \\nneighbors in the General Mobile Radio Service. GMRS licensees can use base or \\nmobile stations up to fifty-watts of power and there is no license test just a simple \\non-line application. Supplemental very-local short-distance neighborhood \\ncommunication in the same vicinity is available in the Family Radio Service. A \\nGMRS licensee can report to an EOC on GMRS frequencies provided the EOC \\nhas a licensed GMRS operator. \\n4. The VHF Multi-Use Radio Service can be used for short-distance neighborhood \\ncommunication and possibly for communication back to an EOC.  \\n5. OEM’s should not overlook companies with fleets of radios in the various \\nbusiness radio services. Company vehicles with radios could be positioned with \\nCERT teams and communicate back to an EOC.  \\n  \\n  \\nAssumptions about the Personal Radio Services \\n  \\n1. Many persons using FRS radios will have little or no prior communication \\ntraining. They will have no confidence in the method or the device. Some may \\neven refuse to own or learn to use one. \\n2. Radios may prove completely frustrating to some people and they will give up \\nusing them and resort to calling out for help. Planners should plan around both \\nscenarios and NOT rely solely on two-way radios. \\n3. Some area residents may have read or heard about the Family Radio Channel One \\ndisaster scheme and may actually start calling out on FRS 1 after an emergency. It \\nis unrealistic to expect that every disaster worker can carry an FRS radio but those \\nthat can or are allowed to should. This may be helpful if FRS or GMRS is used \\nfor supplemental communication in a remote area.  \\n4. Calling out for help, if within earshot of a neighbor, makes more sense than taking \\nthe time to find one’s radio. Neighbors in no immediate peril will exit their homes \\nsafely and begin checking on others. CERT volunteers are trained to assist in \\nsituations where their safety is concerned.  Some disaster victims in severely \\ndamaged structures will have to wait for professional rescuers whether they call \\nfor help out loud or using an FRS radio. \\n5. Some persons may have no or very limited experience with a two-way radio. \\nFinding the push-to-talk function may be difficult for some.  \\n6. Some users of FRS and GMRS radios will panic and cause unwanted interference \\ntrying to reach anyone they can hear. They may even unwittingly interfere with \\nrescues in progress. Batteries could be exhausted within hours of the disaster. \\nWhen these radios are used in a neighborhood the local trainers should explain',\n",
              " 'wilderness protocols so that battery life is extended and the likelihood of a rescue \\nimproved as time proceeds. \\na. Wilderness protocol:  (modified from an example used by the Amateur \\nRadio Service. All stations (both fixed, portable or mobile) monitor \\nPersonal Radio Service frequencies every three hours. Monitoring \\nlocations that have sufficient power resources monitor for five minutes \\nstarting at the top of every hour, or continuously.  \\nb. Scan all frequencies. This increases the possibility that trapped persons \\nwho cannot properly operate a radio might be heard. \\n  \\n7. Some users of radios may be trapped in buildings or in other dangerous locations. \\nIt may be difficult to locate these people. Some very-local responders should be \\ntrained in simple radio direction finding techniques to approximate the location of \\ntrapped radio users. (Body fading.)  Local Amateur Radio Service volunteers and \\nSquadrons of the Civil Air Patrol have expertise in radio direction finding. \\n8. CTCSS and DCS settings will prevent communication and cause severe \\nconfusion. The public should be taught to use radios with these squelch codes \\ndisabled. \\n9. Individuals with criminal intent may attempt to take advantage of persons in \\ndistress, or fake distress calls in order to identify the location of law enforcement \\nor search and rescue resources or unprotected properties to coordinate looting. \\n10. The lack of training and sophistication of users requires extraordinary personal \\ncommunication and negotiation abilities of persons carrying radios and \\nresponding to victims. Some pre-disaster communications training is required. \\n11. CB may be useless or of very limited range. Most CB’s will be in cars. There will \\nbe a few base stations. Communication during periods of active shortwave skip \\nmay be limited depending on local terrain. \\n12. MURS users will be scarce. \\n13. Many families will already own an FRS or a GMRS bubble-pack radio. Not \\neveryone in the family will know how to use them. In most cases batteries will be \\ndead or will soon be dead since most radios cannot be recharged in a vehicle. \\n14. Some two-way radio users will not cooperate with neighborhood groups and will \\ndo as they please. Some may even cause deliberate interference. \\n15. Some smaller groups will organize and use FRS and GMRS radios without being \\npart of a larger plan. OEM officials will eventually learn about these groups and \\nhave difficulty verifying their authenticity. Some may lay claim to specific radio \\nfrequencies as their own. (Licensing encourages people to follow rules that \\nprevent mutual interference.) \\n16. Local business radio users are going to be using their own business radio \\nchannels. OES OEM should coordinate with companies that have large fleets to \\ntake advantage of business repeaters and high powered simplex radios.',\n",
              " 'Planning \\n  \\n•        Participants using GMRS should license in GMRS. Planning should include \\nlocal GMRS licensees. There should be an effort to license families in GMRS \\nin America’s neighborhoods that want to help each other during or \\nimmediately after an emergency using two-way radios. \\n•        Encourage local jurisdictions to have an FRS GMRS communications plan \\nwithin the existing FCC Rules governing both services. These jurisdictions \\nshould locate and negotiate with all GMRS resources. \\n•        GMRS based organizations can create a committee to explore the appropriate \\nuse of the FRS in an emergency for their area and make recommendations to \\nOES/OEMs. GMRS groups should support community based disaster \\ncommunication plans and work within those plans to provide public \\nemergency communications.   \\n•        GMRS repeater owners should invite new families onto their systems so \\nfamilies get used to operating GMRS radio systems. \\n•        The public needs informative packets, and training information.    No disaster \\nprogram will work without training.  This includes extremely basic radio \\noperation instructions, storage of spare batteries, and disaster related supplies. \\nSuch training should be provided through local offices of emergency \\nmanagement or groups with CERT affiliations, Neighborhood Watch, \\ncommunity associations etc. \\n•        Set the public expectation of FRS channel one as an emergency radio \\nfrequency to summon assistance on demand. Remember, OEM’s warn \\npersons in areas anticipating weather related emergencies that public safety \\ncannot respond to telephone calls immediately after a disaster. Calling for help \\nor rescue on a Family Radio Service portable radio does not increase your \\nchances of emergency assistance. \\n•        In a local plan make use of radio frequencies after surveying your areas \\nnormal activity. Create a primary and backup channel.  Do not put simplex \\nradio traffic on a local repeater output. \\n•        Know your neighbors ahead of time. Get to know folks on a first and last \\nname basis before the disaster strikes. \\n•        Have designated alternates for important tasks.',\n",
              " '•        Every family should have a communications plan for a disaster. This includes \\na telephone contact plan, family-expectation setting regarding future welfare \\nrelated telephone calls. Every family should have one designated contact \\nperson far from the emergency (another city or state) that can be a single point \\nof contact for all family members. \\n•        Disaster communications planners, while taking into consideration the \\nlimitations of GMRS and FRS should: \\na.       Share with neighborhoods the benefits of communicating after an \\nemergency to assess the welfare of persons by radio in a very local \\nway. \\nb.      The need for a neighbor or neighbors to learn how to effectively use a \\ntwo-way radio during and immediately after a disaster. \\nc.       Encourage neighbors to use radios with coded-squelch disabled. \\nd.      Develop local ways for neighborhoods to communicate with \\nOES/OEM officials. \\n  \\nSuggestions \\n  \\n1. A neighborhood should standardize on a particular make and model of FRS radio \\n(if possible) for those people that have no prior experience using radios and that \\nmight be likely to have problems using their radios. \\n2. Pick a radio that uses regular alkaline batteries you can replace. When electricity \\nis out you may not be able to recharge your rechargeable batteries. \\n3. Some simple method of wearing the radio on the belt, around the neck, or clipped \\nto clothing should be devised so it is not lost. (Especially for the elderly and the \\nsick.) \\n4. Use of call tones should be discouraged. These tones serve no useful purpose. \\nThey make the radio an obnoxious toy. \\n5. A neighborhood communications volunteer should set up FRS radios for those \\nthat cannot do it properly themselves. \\n6. Neighborhoods should have Block Captains. Block Captains have the \\nresponsibility to call everyone on the radio during and after a disaster to verify the \\nwelfare of people in the homes and buildings around them. \\n7. Large buildings should have designated Floor Captains and alternates that carry \\nradios. Every building should have a communications plan in place with their \\nevacuation plan. It is not realistic that every employee should carry an FRS radio',\n",
              " 'in a business structure but key employees that are part of the neighborhood \\ndisaster plan should do so. \\n8. A neighborhood’s radio system should be tested at least four times a year. A good \\ntime may be just prior to a Neighborhood Watch meeting or local disaster \\npreparedness meeting. Neighbors should use their radios informally all year so \\nthey become familiar with the radio. \\n9. As many volunteers as can be found should take CERT training so everyone \\nresponding to calls from help can so do with some confidence and without injury. \\n10. CERT teams should not have to design or re-design communications systems or \\nmethods already included in their local disaster plans. CERT emphasis is on \\nrescue and public welfare. Disaster planners should do this work for CERT \\nvolunteers. \\n11. Neighbors who want to license in the GMRS should pay the license fee, and buy a \\nbase station and mobile radio capable of attaching to an external antenna. These \\nneighbors can be a link to a designated resource up the communications chain. \\n12. Amateur Radio operators in the neighborhood should be identified and included \\nin neighborhood communications planning. Amateurs can serve as a \\nneighborhood’s link back to the designated public safety agency. Areas with great \\ndistances between neighborhoods can benefit from such a scheme.   \\n13. A neighborhood should be included in a multi-hazard functional plan for the \\njurisdiction in which it is located. Contact persons, and their addresses and phone \\nnumbers should be kept up to date for every local neighborhood. This is easier to \\ndo through Neighborhood Watch or Neighborhood Association meetings since \\nthese are regularly conducted by local police jurisdictions. \\n14. When using a radio to talk to a neighbor use plain language. Do not use ten codes. \\n15.  Use radio codes instead of plain language only if you can guarantee there will be \\nno misunderstandings.  \\n16. Maritime communities should think about communicating with each other on \\nGMRS and FRS. VHF maritime channels cannot be legally used on land. The \\nmaritime channels may be busy with maritime distress activities. \\n17. Teach everyone who owns a radio how to use the radio with specific emphasis on: \\na. Listening before transmitting \\nb. Disabling CTCSS and DCS \\nc. Disabling scrambling \\nd. Speaking in plain language. \\ne. Directing all communications to a specific person or unit. \\nf. Responding only to known persons. \\ng. How to make a general call to anyone that can hear you only when you \\ncannot reach designated persons. \\nh. Having enough batteries on hand to use your radio continuously for at \\nleast seventy-two hours. \\ni. Keeping your radio and batteries within easy to reach, away from areas \\nthat might be damaged during earthquakes or storms. \\nj. In advance warning of an emergency putting your radio on your belt or \\nclipping it to your clothing.',\n",
              " 'k. Putting packs of extra batteries in your pocket in case you are not able to \\nget back to your supply in the event of a building collapse. \\nl. In advance of a disaster warning, attempt to contact other members of \\nyour neighborhood group and check in with Block Captains. Block \\nCaptains should have paper and pencil to record names and addresses of \\ncheck-ins. It is also good to know who has already evacuated.  \\nm. Have a current neighborhood map with address numbers, telephone \\nnumbers, and names of families recorded on the map. \\nn. After a disaster Block Captains should contact every person that checked \\nin and attempt to contact those that did not. \\no. Block Captains should allow persons in actual distress to check in before \\nthose that are not. Everyone needs to know they are helped by \\nneighborhood resources on a priority basis!  \\np. Persons in distress should begin transmitting the moment they determine \\ntheir vocal cries for help are not being heard. Transmit and listen, transmit \\nand listen. “This is Bill on Main St. Please help me.” Stop transmitting \\nwhen you are called or are asked to do so. Indicate you are injured when \\nyou are called. State your name, last known location (where you should \\nbe), and the nature of your emergency.  (follow a suggested wilderness \\nprotocol like that mentioned in this document)   \\nq. Signaling in the event you cannot speak. Radios require speech, but you \\ncan create a method of signaling, or responding to yes and no questions if \\nyou can tap or rub the radio against a solid object while transmitting. \\nWhatever system you develop should be widely understood among the \\nneighbors and only used as a last resort. Be prepared to answer once for \\nyes two for no. \\nr. Preventing an open-microphone condition and what to do if one happens \\ne.g. switching to an alternate channel. \\n  \\n  \\nOES/OEM’s, Public Safety - Make a Commitment Now \\n  \\nThere are some considerations in this list that are frankly, a little outside the scope of \\nFRS and GMRS but these should be considered so that FRS and GMRS use can be \\nconsidered in context by disaster planners. \\n  \\n• \\nOES/OEM’s that plan for supplemental communication functions need to \\nencourage and train volunteers through drills and organized training. Volunteers \\nneed encouragement, recognition, drills, training etc.',\n",
              " '• \\nDetermine the supplemental communications needs of every neighborhood, \\npublic safety agency, major utility etc and work your volunteers into those places. \\nAmateur Radio RACES and ARES should be your primary supplemental civilian \\ncommunications resource.  \\n• \\nIn the case of Amateur Radio volunteers, Public Safety agencies, particularly \\npolice, have an obligation to use Amateurs as RACES volunteers and not ARES \\nvolunteers. This does not mean the local Ham population has to be Balkanized! \\nThis just means that Hams assigned to work a specific agency are volunteers at \\nthat agency as well as members of the local ARES. They wear two hats. Public \\nSafety agencies often fingerprint RACES volunteers.  This allows agencies to \\nassert some control over the quality and integrity of volunteers that serve. In most \\ncases it also qualifies volunteers to receive workman’s compensation insurance \\nbenefits if injured in the line of duty. \\n• \\nActively train and provide drills for volunteers.  \\n• \\nAvoid using your communications volunteers in other roles. It makes sense to \\ntrain communications volunteers so that they understand the concepts behind the \\ndisaster mitigation effort. Their expertise is however communications. After a \\ndisaster, that expertise is valuable and in some cases they may prove more \\nvaluable as a communicator than as neighborhood search and rescue volunteer.  \\n• \\nEncourage firefighters, Dispatch, OES/OEM, medical personnel, and police \\nofficers to become Amateur Radio operators. These folks are often highly \\nmotivated leaders of volunteers. They understand how to get things done in \\ngovernment and planners tend to take them seriously. Volunteers feel honored to \\nserve alongside their very qualified partners. It can truly make a difference in \\ntraining, and effectiveness to have 911 staff, police staff, and even firefighters \\nbecome Amateur radio operators. \\n• \\nBy making a commitment you are more likely to identify those volunteers that \\nshould not be part of a program before an emergency occurs. You can also work \\nwith local volunteer groups to create other useful jobs for volunteers. When you \\nset standards and set expectations for volunteers you will have a better program. \\n• \\nSetting up a grass-roots neighborhood supplemental communications plan is \\ndifficult. The reason is that the people doing the communicating are not \\nnecessarily radio or communications enthusiasts. Their primary interest is the \\nsafety of family and neighbors. (CERT) Whatever you decide to set up should not \\ndiminish the primary role of the CERT volunteer. \\n• \\nAn OES/OEM may not have the resources to train communicators but your local \\nAmateur/GMRS population does! It is what they already do. They can serve you \\nwell in this function. Trainers that are currently or former public safety employees \\nmake excellent trainers. Work hard to develop a trainer’s skills and help them \\nwrite a training program with which your agency is comfortable. \\n• \\nAvoid competing communications volunteer programs. Political jurisdictions \\nshould make this a requirement for OES/OEM’s and all volunteer groups. There \\nis no room for griping, finger pointing, politics, or empire building in \\ncommunications disaster planning. That message must be conveyed to volunteers. \\nPlans should not be Balkanized among or across clubs or special interest groups.',\n",
              " '• \\nCERT volunteers needing communications should not be in the position of having \\nto set up their own communications methodologies without appropriate \\nleadership. You do not want these groups re-inventing the wheel. Involve RACES \\nvolunteers and GMRS licensees as communicators for CERT teams. \\n• \\nWhen you find it difficult to recruit communications volunteers work harder at it. \\nAsk people why they no longer bother to volunteer and you may be surprised. It is \\nnot necessarily their age or lack of interest. On the contrary, it is often that when \\nvolunteers do express an interest in serving the various jurisdictions do not take \\nthe volunteers seriously. Amateur Radio Operators have often been in the \\nposition, despite an incredible record of service, of having to sell their capabilities \\nand themselves to political jurisdictions over and over again because the \\njurisdictions do not take the Amateurs seriously. The same goes for GMRS \\ngroups. Do not wait for them to come to you, go to them. Over and over again \\nAmateurs have proven their value perhaps just not you – not yet anyway. \\n• \\nMake sure your OES/OEM leaders are the right people. It is not a desk job. It’s a \\npeople job, an organizers job, a political job, a leadership job, and a tough job.  \\nThe skills required are supervisory, managerial, organizational, and political. \\nThere is a strong emphasis on the ability to manage resources and supervise \\nvarious types and levels of volunteer resources. \\n• \\nThe diversity of America’s neighborhoods makes an approach to a supplemental \\ncommunications or CERT program different on many levels. How you make it \\nwork and what you do with it is going to depend on very-local circumstances. A \\nCERT approach in a farming community is going to necessarily be different than \\na CERT approach in an inner city apartment building. \\n• \\nWhen you create very-local communications plans decide first what it is you want \\nthese communicators to do. Is communicating their job or is communication \\nnecessary to get their real job done? These are two very different things. An \\nAmateur Radio operator trains to provide supplemental communications and it is \\nhis or her job. A CERT neighbor trains to rescue an elderly neighbor from the \\ndebris of a collapsed building and he/she needs to communicate status and \\nrequests for additional resources while getting their real work done. This is also \\none major reason why you do not want a CERT leader to have to reinvent \\ncommunications plans! Assign a communicator to find and train your CERT in \\nthe appropriate radio service that can provide tactical communication after an \\nemergency. The communicator then trains the trainers who train the neighbors. \\n• \\nTraining is easier than you think. Start train-the-trainer programs for \\nneighborhood volunteers. \\n• \\nStandardize training. Use handouts, Power Point, lectures, and demonstrations. \\n• \\nTrain people not only how to do something but also discuss why it is so \\nimportant. Discuss the potential consequences for plan failures due to modified \\npersonal interpretations and implementations. \\n• \\nOEM’s and communications trainers should identify loose canons – people with \\nscary security guard mentalities, or personality problems that can make them a \\nliability and not an asset. Neighborhoods can find something for these folks to do \\nbut they should not be responsible for the success of a program if they are not \\nlikely to follow rules, guidelines, laws, or policies. It is OK to set standards and',\n",
              " 'ask neighborhood volunteers to accept those standards. Develop volunteer \\nagreements that contain a span of control, and a scope of work and a defined \\nchain of command within your Incident Command System. Standards of behavior \\nand the organization of the volunteer service need to be clearly understood. \\nVolunteers must be required to sign a document indicating their understanding of \\npolicies and procedures.  \\n• \\nIt is highly recommended that any disaster communications volunteer having \\nofficial access to restricted areas be trained as CERT volunteers are in the local \\nIncident Command System and that they be fingerprinted and at a minimum those \\nfingerprints are checked through your state’s Department of Justice (CORI) or \\nequivalent using procedures in place for public safety applicants. Volunteers with \\ncriminal records should be excused from service. \\n  \\n  \\nA Quick Look at the Personal Radio Services \\n  \\nCitizens Radio Service \\n  \\n• \\nThe service was originally created to provide the public with a simple, low-cost \\nradio service on which to conduct personal business or commerce. \\n• \\nCB was created in the high-end of the short-wave radio spectrum. It is the old \\nAmateur Radio Services eleven meter band. \\n• \\nShort-wave radio signals propagate over great distances.  Low power CB radio \\n can be heard around the world. Every eleven years the sunspot cycle causes \\nreliable world-wide propagation. \\n• \\nThe first CB rules and those of today forbid operators from talking to others that \\nare over one-hundred fifty miles away.  \\n• \\nWhen average citizens discovered they could talk great distances like Amateur \\nRadio operators they began using CB illegally to “shoot skip.”  CB was rendered \\na useless wasteland by these outlaw hobbyists. \\n• \\nThe problem of illegal CB use became so great that the FCC abandoned licensing \\nof CB stations. The FCC even abandoned enforcement to a great extent by asking \\nCongress to allow local jurisdictions to investigate complaints of illegal power \\namplifiers. The FCC does still occasionally locate and fine illegal operators but \\ntheir emphasis has now been placed on enforcement activities directed at retailers \\nof illegal CB radio equipment. \\n• \\nThere is now complete anarchy on CB. Illegal hobbyists have had control of the \\nband for decades.',\n",
              " '• \\nIllegal CB operations were the impetuous behind extraordinarily restrictive \\ncovenants, codes, and restrictions against radio operation in homes and \\nneighborhoods. In some areas of the country housing discrimination is reportedly \\nbeing practiced against licensed radio hobbyists – including Amateur Radio \\nOperators. \\n• \\nThe use of illegal CB power amplifiers is still a problem throughout the United \\nStates. \\n• \\nThere are very few home CB base stations now. \\n• \\nCB is widely used by the trucking industry so drivers can communicate with each \\nother on the highways and in some cases their delivery depots. \\n• \\nCB hobby communication is frequently profane, off-color, and juvenile. Most \\nwould say it is not a radio service they would want their children to listen to. \\n• \\nCB is still used by some Americans in cars, by four-wheel-drive enthusiasts, in \\nboats, and RV’s. \\n• \\nThe useful distance of a CB radio is greatly reduced during periods of short-wave \\nband openings due to illegal hobby operations.  \\n• \\nVery-local distance expectations between mobile units can be from less than one \\nmile to tens of miles. \\n• \\nThe CB clubs of the past died out with the popularity of CB.  \\n• \\nFour-wheel drive clubs often have CB radios in all member vehicles. These clubs \\ncould be an excellent communications and transportation resource. They have \\ntheir own communication and provide vehicles that can go where many cannot. \\n• \\nCB walkie-talkie’s have very limited range because of low-profile and very \\ninefficient antennas. \\n• \\nCB might be a useful way for neighbors in rural areas to talk to each other if they \\nlive within a few miles. \\n• \\nLocal CB communication may be better at night when, in most cases, hobby \\noperations cease as signal propagation decreases. \\n• \\nCB should not be considered a highly reliable communications resource. \\nWherever you plan to use it, test it first. Insist that all use of radios be legal. Never \\nallow illegal linear amplifiers to be used by volunteers. Planners should question \\nthe integrity of any volunteer breaking FCC Rules. \\n• \\nThere are legitimate users of CB that do use their radios for family \\ncommunication. The PRA believes that encouraging such use may eventually \\nhave an effect of the usefulness of the radio service.',\n",
              " 'Multi-Use Radio Service \\n  \\n• \\nThe Multi-Use Radio Service consists of five VHF radio frequencies. Operation \\non these frequencies does not require an FCC license; however, unlicensed \\noperation does require that transceivers meet very specific FCC MURS \\nrequirements.  \\n• \\nTransceivers that do not meet MURS requirements may not be used without an \\nFCC license. There are still licensed businesses sharing these radio channels. \\n• \\nSome major radio manufacturers were not pleased with the FCC’s decision to \\ncreate the MURS service and for this reason have stubbornly refused to make \\nequipment for it. Because of this, MURS radios are not as easy to find or purchase \\nas one might think. \\n• \\nVHF radio waves propagate better through forested areas. \\n• \\nTwo watts on VHF may go considerably farther than two watts on UHF GMRS. \\n• \\nBusinesses and unscrupulous radio dealers put customers on these five \\nfrequencies and deliberately failed to license. The widespread abuse of the \\nlicensing requirement prompted the FCC to license-by-rule just as the FCC did \\nwith the CB band. \\n• \\nLow-power VHF generally does not propagate like short-wave radio. \\n• \\nInterference is likely to come from existing business users and unlicensed \\nbusiness users. \\n• \\nInterference is more likely in urban areas. \\n• \\nThese frequencies are often used as drive-up window channels at restaurants and \\nas portable-to-portable business radios in stores, warehouses, malls, construction \\nsites, and as itinerant devices. \\n• \\nUsers of this radio service are required to share the frequencies they use. \\n• \\nMURS would be an acceptable very-local communications option for a \\nneighborhood, particular where forests and rolling hills are plentiful. \\n  \\n  \\nFamily Radio Service \\n  \\n• \\nThe FRS is a license-free very-short-range radio service. \\n• \\nFRS channels one through seven are shared with the General Mobile Radio \\nService.  \\n• \\nGMRS licensees may have small base stations up to five watts effective radiated \\npower on FRS one through seven. This rule can make FRS in a neighborhood \\nuseful if one licensed resident can communicate well with many local hand-held \\nFRS radios.',\n",
              " '• \\nFRS channels eight through fourteen are exclusive to the FRS. \\n• \\nFamilies and businesses are both allowed to use radios that are FCC approved for \\nthe Family Radio Service. \\n• \\nAnarchy reigns on the FRS in urban areas. Interference can be severe. \\n• \\nFRS radio waves travel line of sight.  \\n• \\nAntenna height is more important to range than is the power of the radio. \\nCommunication over tens of miles is possible from high altitudes. \\n• \\nHeavily forested areas limit the range of FRS. UHF radio waves are absorbed by \\nvegetation. \\n• \\nIntentional interference on FRS is common. Call tones are typically used to \\ninterfere and annoy others. \\n• \\nVery-local use of FRS around a neighborhood or a home is very effective.  \\n• \\nFRS radios are limited to one-half watt output. \\n• \\nOnly the United States and Canada share a Family Radio Service on the same \\nfrequencies.  Use of FRS radios in other countries is illegal. Some persons have \\nobtained prior permission to use FRS frequencies in other countries but this is the \\nexception and not the rule. \\n• \\nManufacturer marketing claims of useful communication beyond several hundred \\nfeet to one half mile are greatly exaggerated and intended only to sell radios by \\ncreating unrealistic expectations in the minds of consumers. \\n• \\nChildren should not use FRS radios unsupervised. Parents should know who their \\nchildren are talking to especially with the new Hasbro text-messaging radios. \\n• \\nFRS radios are unfortunately also used by criminals. \\n• \\nUse of FRS radios as children’s toys should be discouraged. \\n• \\nUse of FRS radios and other two-way radios by hunters to coordinate the hunting \\nof game may be regulated in some states. In some states it is considered \\nunsportsmanlike conduct to coordinate the hunt using two-way radios. \\n• \\nFRS radios are perfect for neighbors to use to keep in touch before, during, and \\nafter disasters. \\n• \\nFCC rules prohibit FRS radio connection to external antennas. \\n• \\nFCC rules prohibit FRS radio connection to telephone systems. \\n• \\nFCC rules prohibit FRS radio connection to store and forward repeaters.  \\n  \\n  \\nGeneral Mobile Radio Service \\n  \\n• \\nUse of GMRS is limited to personal licensees. Organizations, clubs, and \\nbusinesses are not eligible to license in GMRS. Individuals are licensed upon \\napplication and payment of a license fee. The renewable license is good for five \\nyears. \\n• \\nPersonal licensees may conduct their personal business.',\n",
              " '• \\nA person’s GMRS license covers their immediate family members including \\nmembers of the immediate family not living in the licensee’s home. \\n• \\nA licensee is responsible for the proper operation of all radio equipment used as \\npart of the licensee’s system.  \\n• \\nGMRS base stations and mobile units may use external antennas and power \\noutputs up to fifty watts. \\n• \\nGMRS licensees may use up to five watts effective radiated power on GMRS \\ninterstitial channels also known as Family Radio Service channels one through \\nseven. \\n• \\nGMRS allows the use of radio repeater stations. \\n• \\nHigher power outputs of GMRS radios make communications more reliable over \\ngreater distances. \\n• \\nGMRS repeaters are considered private property. Repeaters may be shared by \\nlicensees but sharing agreements must be in writing and kept with station records. \\n  \\n  \\nMethods of Communication for Very-local Communication (Under development) \\n  \\nThe following suggestions are for very-local neighborhood groups. Your implementation \\nmay vary depending upon colloquial circumstances. This is not a one-size fits all \\napproach.  \\n  \\n• \\nThe planner wants to choose simple-language communication methods rather than \\ntry to teach ten-codes or other similar codes used by public safety communicators. \\nThe general public speaks in words so stick with plain language call signs also \\ncalled tactical identifiers.  \\n• \\nMinimize future confusion by encouraging neighbors to use their radios for \\nfamily use and events around the neighborhood. \\n• \\nMake FRS radios and perhaps even GMRS a tool of your local Neighborhood \\nWatch.  \\n  \\n  \\nMistakes to Avoid',\n",
              " '• \\nCERT organizations have no right under law to issue GMRS radios to unlicensed \\nvolunteers. There is a trend developing of jurisdictions purchasing the twenty-two \\nchannel bubble-pack GMRS radios and issuing these radios to volunteers. The \\nuniformed believe these are FRS radios.  Jurisdictions tell volunteers to use the \\nchannels that do not require a license and to avoid using the higher power GMRS \\nchannels unless told to do so. Some jurisdictions even make up their own rules to \\nsay when volunteers can use GMRS channels without license authority. This is \\ninconsistent with the license requirements for these radios and is against FCC \\nRules. It is not good planning. Do not make this mistake or you will run afoul of \\nthe law. Read the GMRS Rules in FCC R&R Part 95. Observe the license \\nrequirements for radios certified as GMRS radios.  \\n• \\nDo not make the assumption that you have the right to do as you please with a \\nGMRS radio because you represent a police, fire, or OEM agency. The Federal \\nCommunications Commission makes the rules and enforces the rules. You may \\nnot interpret the rules for your own benefit. \\n• \\nAmateur Radio operators, public safety jurisdictions, nor OES/OEM’s  should  \\nassume that they have the right to use GMRS radios without a license or to issue \\nGMRS radios to non Hams in order to outfit citizen ACS teams. (Auxiliary \\nCommunications Service teams.) \\n• \\nAssume that your illegal operations on GMRS will be noticed. Do not break the \\nlaw. There is an ever growing membership of the Personal Radio Association \\ntaking responsibility for monitoring GMRS nationwide. Unlicensed operation is \\nreported to the Federal Communications Commission. You could find you or your \\nagency having to explain to the FCC why you have ignored and operated outside \\nof the FCC Rules. \\n• \\nDo not permit Amateur Radio operators assisting as communications volunteers \\nto use modified Amateur Radio equipment on GMRS frequencies. This is not \\nallowed under FCC Rules. Permitting your volunteers to break the law is not the \\nright thing to do. Local ARES/RACES leaders should certify that all Amateur \\nRadio communications disaster service volunteers do not operate with modified \\nequipment. \\n• \\nDo not permit public safety employees to program GMRS channels in public \\nsafety radios or to use modified Amateur Radios on public safety frequencies. \\n• \\nDo not assume that your organization has the right to commandeer a GMRS or \\nFRS channel for your exclusive use. \\n  \\n  \\nOpportunities for Manufacturers \\n  \\nManufacturers have gone about the development and marketing of FRS radios in all the \\nwrong ways. Development is entirely about what the marketing manager expects will',\n",
              " 'tempt the average citizen to buy the product without regard to licensing. The marketers \\nwant the radios loaded with features. They insist on making bizarre claims as to the range \\nradios will transmit effectively.  It is all about what a marketing manager believes will \\nsell the product and not at all about how useful the radio actually is. The most glaring \\nexamples are the intentional built-in complexities of these radios that should be so \\nincredibly simple. Set-up menus and multiple controls confuse and bemuse the average \\ncitizen making the radios almost impossible to use. One excellent argument against the \\nuse of today’s FRS/GMRS bubble-pack radios for use in emergency situations was put \\nthis way: \\n  \\n “Take any two FRS (or bubble-pack GMRS) radios from competing \\nmanufacturers and set each radio on a different channel with different call \\ntones. Hand the radios to an average person with an instruction book and \\nask them to set the radios up so they can talk to each other.” One or both \\npeople will certainly give up and setting up a radio to communicate during \\nan emergency is too late! \\n  \\nManufacturers have an opportunity to reverse confusion by developing FRS only radios \\nfor use in neighborhoods as radios for crime prevention teams or CERT with the \\nfollowing features: \\n  \\n1. FRS only channels so radios can be used license free. \\n2. Elimination of the tone-coded squelch option. \\na. Eliminates complicated set up  \\nb. Eliminates problems associated with model differences between \\nmanufacturers \\nc. Eliminates interference to GMRS repeaters when operated on FRS eight \\nthrough fourteen. \\nd. Enables persons to quickly and easily talk to each other. \\n3. Elimination of the call tone feature. This feature has rarely served a useful \\npurpose. It is most frequently used to interfere with and to annoy others. It makes \\nthe radio a toy. \\n4. Simple one-button scan function. \\n  \\nWhy make the changes?',\n",
              " '• \\nCTCSS and DCS tones are difficult to set up in most radios. \\n• \\nManufacturers market CTCSS and DCS tones as privacy feature when it is \\nanything but a privacy feature.  \\n• \\nMost people with CTCSS or DCS enabled will never listen first before \\ntransmitting and often interfere with others. \\n• \\nAn FRS radio with CTCSS or DCS enabled will prevent communication with \\nothers. \\n• \\nMenu and push-button function set up methods are confusing and difficult to \\nmaster. \\n• \\nFeature rich radios are communication poor. \\n• \\nReduced complexity emphasizes voice communication. \\n• \\nAn FRS-only radio is license free. Something that that has escaped the attention \\nof manufacturers and marketing managers for a number of years.  \\n  \\nMost serious GMRS licensees invest in high quality commercial-grade two-way radio \\nequipment and have invested a great deal of money in this equipment. Commercial-grade \\nradios last longer, are more reliable, and in many cases much simpler to use. These radios \\nmay be of similar quality and manufacture as radios in use by public safety agencies. \\n  \\n  \\nMarine Radio \\n  \\nThe 156-160 MHz marine band is intended for use on the water. It is illegal to use a land \\nbased marine radio transceiver unless the station is licensed as a coast station by the FCC. \\nObtaining a coast station license is not easy. Only businesses and public safety agencies \\nhaving a need to communicate with vessels on the water is even eligible. Activities of the \\nCoast Guard are also covered in Federal regulations.

NOAA Weather Radio is the best means for receiving warn-\\nings from the National Weather Service. The National Weather Service con-\\ntinuously broadcasts updated weather warnings and forecasts that can be\\nreceived by NOAA Weather Radios sold in many stores. NOAA Weather\\nRadio now broadcasts warning and postevent information for all types of\\nhazards — both natural (such as earthquakes and volcanic activity) and\\ntechnological (such as chemical releases or oil spills). Working with other\\nfederal agencies and the Federal Communications Commission’s new\\nEmergency Alert System, NOAA Weather Radio is an “all hazards” radio\\nnetwork, making it the single source for the most comprehensive weather\\nand emergency information available to the public. Your National Weather\\nService recommends purchasing a radio that has both a battery backup \\nand a Specific Area Message Encoder (SAME) feature, which automatically\\nalerts you when a watch or warning is issued for your county, giving you\\nimmediate information about a life-threatening situation. The average\\nrange is 40 miles, depending on topography; the National Weather Radio\\nsignal is a line-of-sight signal, which does not bore through hills or \\nmountains.\\nWater\\nHaving an ample supply of clean water is a top priority in an emergency.\\n• Store water in plastic containers, such as soft drink plastic bot-\\ntles. Seal containers tightly, label them and store in a cool, dark place.\\nReplace water every six months. Avoid using containers that will\\ndecompose or break, such as milk cartons or glass bottles.',\n",
              " '• Keep at least a three-day supply of water, or a minimum of\\nthree gallons per person. It is strongly recommended to have more \\nif possible. Use one-half gallon per day for drinking, and one-half gallon\\nfor cooking and sanitation. A normally active person needs to drink at\\nleast two quarts of water each day. Hot environments and intense phys-\\nical activity can double that amount. Children, nursing mothers, and ill\\npeople will need more. Store your three-day supply in a handy place.\\nYou need to have water packed and ready in case there is no time to \\nfill water bottles when disaster strikes.\\n• Water needs to be treated only if it is of questionable purity. \\nI \\nBoiling is the safest method of treating water. Strain water through a\\nclean cloth to remove bulk impurities. Bring water to a rolling boil\\nfor about one full minute, keeping in mind that some water will\\nevaporate. Let the water cool before drinking. Boiled water will taste\\nbetter if you put oxygen back into it by pouring the water back and\\nforth between two clean containers. This will also improve the taste\\nof stored water.\\nI \\nYou can use household liquid bleach to kill microorganisms. Use\\nonly regular household liquid bleach that contains 5.25 percent sodi-\\num hypochlorite. Do not use scented bleaches, color-safe bleaches,\\nor bleaches with added cleaners. Add 16 drops of bleach per gallon\\nof water, stir, and let stand for 30 minutes. If the water does not\\nhave a slight bleach odor, repeat the dosage and let stand another\\n15 minutes. If it still does not smell of chlorine, discard it and find\\nanother source of water. Other chemicals, such as iodine or water\\ntreatment products sold in camping or surplus stores that do not\\ncontain 5.25 percent hypochlorite as the only active ingredient, are\\nnot recommended and should not be used.\\nI \\nDistillation involves boiling water and then collecting the vapor that\\ncondenses back to water. The condensed vapor will not include salt\\nor other solid impurities. To distill, fill a pot halfway with water. Tie a\\ncup to the handle on the pot’s lid so that the cup will hang rightside\\nup when the lid is upside down (make sure the cup is not touching\\nthe water) and boil the water for 20 minutes. The water that drips\\nfrom the lid into the cup is distilled.\\n• Melt ice cubes or use water from undamaged hot water tanks,\\ntoilet tanks (not the bowl), and water pipes if you need addition-\\nal water.\\n• If you need to find water outside of your home, you can use\\nrainwater; streams, rivers, and  other moving bodies of water;\\nponds and lakes; and natural springs. If you question its purity,\\nTalking About Disaster: Guide for Standard Messages 23',\n",

Do NOT\\ndrink flood water.\\nFood \\nEven though it is unlikely that an emergency would cut off your food \\nsupply for two weeks, you should consider preparing a supply that will last\\nthat long. The easiest way to develop a two-week stockpile is to increase\\nthe amount of basic foods you normally keep on your shelves. If your water\\nsupply is limited, try to avoid foods that are high in fat and protein, and\\ndon’t stock salty foods, since they will make you thirsty.

              " \"Emergency Food For Babies \\nInfants and very small children would be the first victims of starvation during and after a pandemic, unless special \\npreparations are made on their behalf. They need foods that are more concentrated and less rough. Most \\nAmerican mothers do not nurse their infants, and if a family's supply of baby foods were exhausted the parents \\nmight experience the agony of seeing their baby slowly starve. Under unsanitary conditions, it is safer to make a \\nformula 3 times a day. To do so, add 1/3 cup plus 2 teaspoons (a little less than one ounce) of instant nonfat milk \\npowder to 1-1/3 cups (2/3 pint) of boiled water, and stir thoroughly. Then add 1 tablespoon (about 1/3 ounce, or 9 \\ngrams) of vegetable oil and 2 teaspoons of sugar, and stir. (If regular bakers' milk powder is used, 1/4 cup is \\nenough when making one-third of the daily formula, 3 times a day.) If baby bottles are not at hand, milk can be \\nspoon-fed to an infant. \\nDuring a crisis, the best and most dependable food for an infant is mother's milk provided the mother is assured \\nan adequate diet. The possibility of disaster is one more reason why a mother should nurse her baby for a full \\nyear. Storing additional high-protein foods and fats for a nursing mother usually will be better insurance against \\nher infant getting sick or starving than keeping adequate stocks of baby foods and the equipment necessary for \\nsanitary feeding after evacuation or an attack. \\nTo give a daily vitamin supplement to a baby, a multivitamin pill should be crushed to a fine powder between two \\nspoons and dissolved in a small amount of fluid, so that the baby can easily swallow it. If an infant does not \\nreceive adequate amounts of vitamins A, D, and C, he will develop deficiency symptoms in 1 to 3 months, \\ndepending on the amounts stored in his body. Vitamin C deficiency, the first to appear, can be prevented by \\ngiving an infant 15 mg of vitamin C each day (about 1/3 of a 50-mg vitamin C tablet, pulverized) or customary \\nfoods containing vitamin C, such as orange juice. \\nLacking these sources, the juice squeezed from sprouted grains or legumes can be used. If no vitamin pills or \\nfoods rich in vitamin D are available, exposure of the baby's skin to sunlight will cause his body to produce vitamin \\nD. If sufficient milk is not obtainable, even infants younger than six months should be given solid food. Solid foods \\nfor babies must be pureed to a fine texture. Using a modern baby food grinder makes pureeing quick and easy \\nwork. Under crisis conditions, a grinder should be cleaned and disinfected like other baby-feeding utensils, as \\ndescribed later in this section. Several expedient methods are available: the food can be pressed through a sieve, \\nmashed with a fork or spoon, or squeezed through a porous cloth. Good sanitation must be maintained; all foods \\nshould be brought to a boil after pureeing to insure that the food is safe from bacteria. \\nA pureed solid baby food can be made by first boiling together 3 parts of a cereal grain and 1 part of beans until \\nthey are soft. Then the mixture should be pressed through a sieve. The sieve catches the tough hulls from the \\ngrain kernels and the skins from the beans. The grain-beans combination will provide needed calories and a well-\\nsupplemented protein. The beans also supply the additional iron that a baby needs by the time he is 6 months \\nold. Flours made from whole grains or beans, as previously described, also can be used; however, these may \\ncontain more rough material. Some grains are preferable to others. It is easier to sieve cooked corn kernels than \\ncooked wheat kernels. Since wheat is the grain most likely to cause allergies, it should not be fed to an infant until \\nhe is 6 to 7 months old if other grains, such as rice or corn, are available. Small children also need more protein \\nthan can be supplied by grains alone. \\nAs a substitute for milk, some bean food should be provided at every meal. If the available diet is deficient in a \\nconcentrated energy source such as fat or sugar, a child's feedings should be increased to 4 or 5 times a day, to \\nenable him to assimilate more. Whenever possible, a small child should have a daily diet that contains at least \\none ounce of fat (3 tablespoons, without scraping the spoon). This would provide more than 10% of a young \\nchild's calories in the form of fat, which would be beneficial. \\nIf under emergency conditions it is not practical to boil infant feeding utensils, they can be sterilized with a bleach \\nsolution. Add one teaspoon of ordinary household bleach to a quart of water. (Ordinary household bleach \\ncontains 5.25% sodium hypochlorite as its only active ingredient and supplies approximately 5% available \\nchlorine. If the strength of the bleach is unknown, add 3 teaspoons per quart.) Directions for safe feeding without \\nboiling follow:\",\n",
              " 'Utensils \\n1. Immediately after feeding, wash the inside and outside of all utensils used to prepare the formula and to \\nfeed the infant. \\n2. Fill a covered container with clean, cold water and add the appropriate amount of chlorine bleach. \\n3. Totally immerse all utensils until the next feeding (3 or 4 hours). Be sure that the bottle, if used, is filled \\nwith bleach solution. Keep container covered. \\nAt feeding time: Wash hands before preparing food. Remove utensils from the disinfectant chlorine solution and \\ndrain, but do not rinse or dry. Prepare formula; feed the baby. Immediately after feeding: Wash utensils in clean \\nwater and immerse again in the disinfectant solution. Prepare fresh chlorine solution each day.',\n",

              " '\"Militia Cookbook\" Emergency Food Preparation\\nPage 3 of 37\\nThe Improvised Kitchen\\nYou should have a camping stove for emergency cooking purposes.  Two-burner stoves are useful\\nin a fixed location or if you are vehicle mobile.  Propane stoves are easy to use but fuel is\\nexpensive, the high pressure steel canisters are heavy and not likely to be widely available during\\na long-term emergency.  A multifuel stove capable of using either white gas (lantern fuel or\\nColeman fuel) or ordinary gasoline is easier to resupply in an emergency.  However, gasoline\\nburns hotter than propane and is not as useful for low heat simmering of foods, so it might be wise\\nto have both types of stove.\\nIf you are in a fixed location like a survival retreat or base camp, nothing beats a cast iron skillet,\\ncovered kettle and especially a dutch oven for open fire or hot coal cooking.  An excellent\\nconfiguration for a cooking fire is the keyhole type.  Build a fire ring of rocks with a rectangular\\nextension, build a fire in the circular part and coals can be raked or shoveled into the rectangular\\ncooking area as needed.  A grill or griddle can be supported over the rectangular cooking area\\n(bricks can be used instead of rocks here for more stability) or the area can be used with a dutch\\noven.  A metal tripod (or one fashioned from green branches) to hang a kettle can be used for\\nboiling water or directly cooking over the flames in the circular part of the fire ring.\\nThe book \"Roughing It Easy\" shows how useful heavy duty aluminum foil is for outdoor cooking;\\nstock up.  Also, if you store food in large #10 cans (1 gallon) or in five gallon square cans, get this\\nbook and a pair of tin snips to convert the empty cans into many useful stove and oven variations.\\nA cookie cooling rack can be used over a small pit of coals or an improvised #10 can barbecue.\\nA grill and dutch oven can be arranged to allow simultaneous use as a baking oven and for frying.\\nDig a shallow hole 9 to 12 inches in diameter and 3 to 4 inches deep; place coals or charcoal\\nbriquets in the hole and place the grill across the hole; put the pan containing the item to be baked\\non the grill and cover with an inverted dutch oven; place coals on the base of the dutch oven which\\nis now the top; place the inverted dutch oven lid on the base tripod legs and it becomes a griddle\\nfor frying foods.\\nAnother useful accessory for either base camp cooking or for use in the field is a folding pack\\ngrill.  Such a grill can be used for directly broiling meats, as a stand over the coals for a skillet,\\ngriddle or a stock pot (used for soups and stews, as a steamer or as an oven for baking or roasting),\\nas a reflector oven (using disposable aluminum cooking pans for reflectors), as a stand for an\\ninverted dutch oven lid allowing it to be used for frying, as a dirt free stand for placing a dutch\\noven lid when adding ingredients to or checking the progress of food in the oven and as a stand\\naway from the fire for serving or for safely adding ingredients without burning yourself or spilling\\nthe food.  The Coghlan\\'s brand pack grill is cheap enough (about $3 to $4 in discount stores) that\\nseveral can be purchased for use in a base camp.  A single pack grill and a lightweight nesting\\ncooking set or GI mess kit can be carried in your rucksack to simplify field cooking.\\nYou can also add a folding pocket stove or GI canteen cup stand and solid fuel tablets to your\\nrucksack for reheating prepared foods or preparing hot beverages like instant soup, coffee, tea or\\ncocoa.\\nTo ease the cleanup chore when reheating cooked food, immerse the food container (can, MRE\\npouch, vacuum seal bag or freezer bag) in boiling water in your cooking pot; pierce the food\\ncontainer above the water line so it doesn\\'t explode.  In the field this method of heating food\\nreduces cooking odors and lessens the chance of giving away your unit\\'s position to enemy scouts.\\nA single-burner butane or multifuel backpacking stove can be shared between two or three people.\\nMost butane cartridges nowadays are filled with iso-butane which can be used down to about 20\\ndegrees but, like with two-burner camp stoves, a multifuel stove is easier to resupply.  Get an extra\\nGI canteen cover and you can carry your stove attached to the side of your GI rucksack.',\n",
              " '\"Militia Cookbook\" Emergency Food Preparation\\nPage 4 of 37\\nIf you are on the move without a vehicle or pack animals to carry heavy cooking vessels like cast\\niron skillets and dutch ovens (or in case you get separated from your well stocked rucksack), here\\nare some of the many other ways of cooking food using natural materials described in \"The Green\\nBeret Gourmet\":\\nClay Ovens:\\nConstruct an arched structure of green sticks (similar in shape to a beehive), insert a thick stick\\nvertically through the top to form a flue opening and daub with wet clay until it is completely\\ncovered except for a front opening.  Pile on successive layers of clay until a thick wall is made.\\nAllow the layers to dry between applications by either placing hot coals inside or, if time is not a\\nproblem, by the sun.  If each layer is not thoroughly dry, the oven will crack when you try to use\\nit.  A clay oven can also be made by hammering a thick sharpened stick down through a bank or\\nslope about three feet back from the edge.  Scoop out the size of the oven you want about a foot or\\nso down the bank.  Leave a thick ceiling.  Leave a narrow front opening and dig back and hollow\\nthe bank as far as the stick which you hammered down.  Pull the stick out to form the chimney\\nopening.  Wet your hands and smooth the interior surfaces, then harden the walls by building a\\nsmall fire inside.  After your oven is prepared, to use it build a fire inside.  When the fire has\\nburned down, scrape out the coals and ashes.  Lay food inside on stones, leaves or hardwood slabs.\\nClose off the front opening and flue.  Leave food inside to cook.  Cooking time depends upon the\\ntype of food being cooked.\\nCooking in Natural Containers:\\nA stone with a hollow in it makes an excellent container.  If it is small enough you can build a fire\\naround the stone.  Bark can be used to fashion pots to boil water, cook soups, stews or any foods\\nwith liquids over a fire.  Peel a square of bark and fold the corners inward and hold them in place\\nwith wooden pegs.  Keep the flames from touching your bark pot above the liquid level and your\\nmeal will cook in this simple container.  Large leaves make an instant \"aluminum foil\" when\\nbaking or steaming food, but be sure to use edible nonpoisonous leaves.\\nBaking in Clay.\\nThis method is excellent for small game or fish.  Remove the entrails from the animal being\\nprepared.  This is easiest to do if the animal is already dead.  Do not skin, pluck or scale.  Cover\\nwith a layer of clay about an inch thick.  Place it in hot ashes and build a fire above it.  Cooking\\ntime varies with animal size and taste preference.  A one pound animal will be cooked in\\napproximately 30 to 40 minutes.  The meat will be stripped clean of fur, feathers or scales when\\nyou break off the clay.\\nBaking on a Stick.\\nHeat a peeled green stick by the fire while you prepare a bread dough.  Mix a GI canteen cup of\\nflour with a mound of baking powder the size of a quarter and a dash of salt.  Add water gradually\\nto make a soft dough.  Work quickly so the bread will rise as it bakes.  Wrap dough around heated\\nstick and place upright next to the fire to let it bake.\\nCooking in Ashes.\\nFoodstuff is placed in warm ashes and then covered with embers.  Self-contained foods such as\\nvegetables do not need to be wrapped in anything; simply place them in the ashes and dust them\\noff after cooking.  Cooking time depends upon the type of food and personal preferences.  You\\ncan test vegetables by feeling for softness and putting them back if they still feel firm.\\nCooking on Wood Slabs.\\nSelect a green hardwood slab (evergreens season the food with a pine or turpentine taste) large\\nenough to lash or peg the animal.  Fish and very small game can be successfully cooked this way.\\nClean the animal and flatten down on the slab.  Either pin the animal down with wooden pegs or\\nlash to the slab with whatever is available.  Lean the slab up in front of glowing coals.  Turn a few\\ntimes so the food will cook evenly.',\n",
              " '\"Militia Cookbook\" Emergency Food Preparation\\nPage 5 of 37\\nThis recipe comes from Richmond, Virginia in the Confederate States of America when Yankee\\ninvaders were marauding and food was in short supply:\\nRoasted Rat\\nThe rat must be skinned, cleaned, his head cut off and his body laid upon a square board, the legs\\nstretched to their full extent and secured upon it with small tacks, then baste with bacon fat and\\nroast before a good fire quickly like canvasback ducks.\\nBroiling on a Stick.\\nThis is a good method for cooking a small amount of food.  Fish, birds and small animals (large\\nanimals must be cut into smaller chunks) can be cleaned and then skewered on a peeled green\\nwood stick.  If the food tends to slide, a bark twine can be used to tie it down by splitting the wood\\ndown to the game on both ends and twisting bark through the splits.  Sear the meat in the flame to\\nseal in the juices.  The skewer can be laid over forked green sticks at both ends of an ember bed.\\nAs long as the fire does not flame up, the meat needs only occasional turning so it cooks evenly.\\nSteaming in a Hole.\\nThis method can be used to cook small or enormous amounts of food with great results.  Build a\\nfire and place some stones in it to heat.  Don\\'t select rocks from a stream bed, limestone or\\nsandstone since they can contain trapped moisture and may explode when heated.  While the\\nstones are heating, dig a hole.  Put the stones in the pit and place a thick layer of wet vegetation\\nlike grass or seaweed over them.  Lay the food on top of the wet vegetation and place a stick near\\nthe edge of the pit.  Fill with dirt.  Pull the stick out and pour water down this opening onto the\\nrocks to steam the food.  Tamp down the top and leave the food to steam for at least two or three\\nhours.  If you are cooking something larger than fish or small game, the cooking time will need to\\nbe extended.\\nGrilling\\nMeat can be grilled over the coals if it is fat.  Lean game will end up very dry.  Build a bed of\\nhardwood embers and place a grill matting of green sticks on it.  Place the meat on the grill and\\nturn immediately after the sides are seared to seal in the juices.  Try not to pierce the meat with\\nwhatever you are turning it with so you don\\'t lose any juices.  Keep a small container of water\\nnearby to douse any flames that surface from the fat drippings.',\n",
              " '\"Militia Cookbook\" Emergency Food Preparation\\nPage 6 of 37\\nFire Cake and Hoe Cakes\\nOne of the easiest ways of making flour edible, even if not very appetizing, is to make a simple\\ndough and fry or bake it over a fire.  During the Revolutionary War it was common for soldiers to\\nmake a thick paste of flour and water (salt was added when available) and then bake it on hot\\nrocks around a campfire.  The result was an unpalatable, chewy, soggy glob which only the\\nstarving soldiers at Valley Forge probably appreciated.  Hoe cakes were made from a corn meal\\ndough carried to the fields by slaves and other farm workers.  At lunch they cleaned their hoes, put\\nthe dough on them and cooked it over a fire.\\nEntrenching Tool Cake\\n4 GI canteen cups white cornmeal\\nboiling water\\n1 GI mess kit spoon (1 tablespoon) bacon drippings\\nGI mess kit spoon salt\\nScald cornmeal with enough boiling water to make a stiff batter, then add bacon drippings and\\nsalt.

              " '\"Militia Cookbook\" Emergency Food Preparation\\nPage 7 of 37\\nHardtack\\nDuring the War for Southern Independence, hardtack was a staple food (when fresh bread was\\nunavailable) for both the brutal soldiers of the oppressive Federal government and the brave\\nConfederate patriots defending their homeland.  Hardtack was a virtually indestructible 1/2-inch\\nthick cracker about three inches by three inches, pierced with sixteen holes and made from flour\\nand water.  Tack was a contemptuous term for food and the soldiers \"affectionately\" referred to\\nhardtack as worm castles, sheet iron crackers and tooth dullers.  Some of the hardtack issued to\\nsoldiers in the 1860\\'s was supposedly left over from the 1846-48 Mexican War.  The daily ration\\nwas nine or ten crackers, but there was usually enough for those who wanted more since some\\nmen would not draw a full ration.  They were eaten plain, soaked in coffee or crumbled and added\\nto the stew pot.  A dish known as Skillygalee was made by soaking hardtack in cold water and\\nthen browning it in pork fat and seasoning to taste.  A favorite seasoning of the times was cayenne\\npepper.  Confederate Cush provided a dinner entree that consisted of bits of cooked beef, seasoned\\nwith garlic, fried in bacon grease and then stewed with crumbled hardtack or cornmeal mush.  The\\ncrackers included in military C-rations and the current MREs are similar to hardtack, being much\\nmore dense, containing more flour and less air than commercial saltine crackers.  When fresh,\\nhardtack was not unappetizing, but when boxes of hardtack sat on railroad platforms or\\nwarehouses for months before being issued it hardened and often became insect infested.  Because\\nhardtack was packed in boxes marked \"B.C.\" (probably for \"Brigade Commissary\"), soldiers said\\nthey were so hard because they were baked \"Before Christ\".\\nThe following account from a Yankee invader indicates how much hardtack was appreciated:\\n\"While before Petersburg, doing siege work in the summer of 1864, our men had wormy hardtack,\\nor ship\\'s biscuit, served out to them for a time.  It was a severe trial, and it tested the temper of the\\nmen.  Breaking open the biscuit and finding live worms in them, they would throw the pieces in\\nthe trenches where they were doing duty day by day, although the orders were to keep the trenches\\nclean for sanitary reasons.  A brigade officer of the day, seeing some of the scraps along our front,\\ncalled out sharply to our men \\'Throw that hardtack out of the trenches.\\' Then, as the men men\\npromptly gathered it up as directed, he added, \\'Don\\'t you know that you\\'ve no business to throw\\nhardtack in the trenches? Haven\\'t you been told that often enough?\\' Out from the injured soldier\\nheart there came the reasonable explanation \\'We\\'ve thrown it out two or three times, sir, but it\\ncrawls back.\\'\"\\nHardtack (original 1860\\'s recipe)  Use one part water to six parts flour.  Roll dough flat and score\\ninto cracker shapes.  Bake 20-25 minutes and cool off until completely dry before storing in\\ncanisters.  The crackers should be hard as bricks and indestructibly unappetizing.  If not consumed\\nby hungry soldiers, the crackers might last at least until the Lord returns!\\nThe following recipes don\\'t duplicate the indestructible nature of 19th century hardtack, but they\\nare more appetizing since they are made from more than just flour and water:\\nCorntack\\n1-1/4 cups cornmeal\\n1 cup water (about)\\n1/2 tsp.  salt\\n2 tbsp.  vegetable oil\\nCombine the above ingredients, using enough water to moisten.

Let stand 8 to 12 hours.  To quick soak, bring water and beans to a boil and allow to boil 2\\nminutes.  Cover pot and let stand 1 hour.  The time required for cooking beans is generally 1-1/2\\nto 2 hours, but this depends upon the variety of bean and the length of time they have been stored.\\nCheck beans often as they begin to get tender so they don\\'t get mushy.  Cook at a gentle simmer\\nwith the lid tilted to retain shape.  If beans foam up during cooking, add a tablespoon of oil or fat\\nto the water or cook with a small amount of fat pork or bacon.

One-pot meals in a dutch oven or iron kettle over a fire are still a practical method for\\npreparing a lot of food with minimum effort.  For casseroles the ingredients are mixed together in\\nthe cooking vessel and then baked.  For soups and stews on the stove top or over the fire, the meat\\ngoes in first and vegetables are added towards the end of the cooking time.  If unexpected guests\\nshow up, an extra potato can be quartered and dropped in the stew pot.  If meat is in short supply\\nfor your stew, you can substitute bouillon cubes and a little butter or vegetable oil and add\\npotatoes or dumplings.  Dumplings can be quickly prepared to stretch a meal by adding biscuit\\ndough in small lumps or strips and steaming in the covered pot for 10 to 15 minutes (either use a\\nbiscuit recipe from the previous section or try one of the dumpling recipes below).\\nWhole Wheat Biscuit Mix for Dumplings\\n1 cup white flour\\n1 cup whole wheat flour\\n2 tsp.  baking powder\\n1 tsp.  salt\\n2 tbsp.  shortening or oil\\n1/4 cup powdered milk\\nCombine at home and store in a zip-lock bag or Nalgene bottle.

              " '186\\nVolume 56, No. 2, March/April 2011\\nInstructions for Your Helper During Labor\\nStay calm and keep the area as clean as possible. Help keep the mom comfortable. Place some towels under \\nher to catch fl uid when the bag of waters breaks and for vaginal bleeding that can occur during labor. Th e fi rst \\nstage of labor can last from a few hours to several hours. Once the mother starts grunting or pushing, the fi rst \\nstage is over, and the baby will be born soon. Th e pushing stage can last for just a few minutes but may last an \\nhour or 2 if this is the mother’s fi rst baby.\\nInstructions for Your Helper During the Birth\\nWhen you start to see the head at the opening to the vagina, put on sterile gloves. If you don’t have gloves, \\nwash your hands thoroughly with soap and water or use hand sanitizer.\\n1.  As soon as the head is out, feel around the head to see if the cord is around the baby’s neck. Th e cord is \\nslippery, round, and feels jelly-like.\\n2.  If the cord is around the neck, gently lift  it over the head or push it back behind the shoulders.\\n3.  If the shoulders do not come out immediately: Gently push the side of the baby’s head toward the mother’s \\nback to help the shoulders come out and ask her to push. Once the shoulders are out, the rest of the body \\nwill come quickly.\\n4.  If the shoulders still do not come out: Have the mom lie on her back and pull her knees up toward her \\nchest, then ask her to push. Th is helps move her pelvis up and over the shoulders if they are stuck.\\nInstructions for Your Helper with the New Baby\\n1.  When the baby is born, place the baby on the mother’s bare chest and cover both of them with a blanket. \\nRemove the fi rst wet towel and keep them covered with dry blankets. Place a hat on the baby.\\n2.  If the baby is not crying or breathing easily: Rub the baby’s back up and down fi rmly. Do not spank or hold \\nthe baby upside down.\\n3.  If the baby is still not crying or breathing easily: Turn the baby so he/she is looking up at the ceiling and tilt \\nhis/her head back to straighten the airway, and keep rubbing the back. Once the baby is breathing easily, \\nhe/she will turn pink. Th e baby’s hands and feet will remain bluish for a few hours.\\n4.  If the baby is gagging or turning blue: Use the bulb syringe to clear fl uid from the nose and mouth. If the \\nbaby is still not breathing, start infant CPR.\\n5.  Tie the umbilical cord in 2 places close together about 3 inches from the baby with the white shoestrings. \\nUse a double knot for each. Cut the umbilical cord between the 2 tied-off  sections with sterile scissors. \\nTh ere is no hurry to do this. Th e baby will do best if you wait until you cannot feel a pulse when you hold \\nthe umbilical cord between your fi ngers.\\nInstructions for Your Helper with the Placenta\\n1.  Th e placenta will be ready to come out within a few minutes to about 30 minutes aft er the birth. You may \\nsee a gush of blood and the umbilical cord get longer when the placenta is ready to deliver. Place the bowl \\nnext to the mother’s vagina and ask her to push out the placenta. It will come out with some bleeding and \\nfl uid. Put the placenta in plastic bags.\\n2.  As soon as the placenta is out, the mother’s bleeding will be like bleeding from a heavy period. Getting the \\nbaby to breastfeed is very important, because it will slow down the bleeding aft er birth.\\nAmerican College of Nurse-Midwives\\nFor More Information\\nGiving Birth “In Place” A Guide to Emergency Preparedness for Childbirth\\nhttp://mymidwife.org/Guide-to-Emergency-Childbirth\\nwww.sharewithwomen.org\\nTh is page may be reproduced for noncommercial use by health care professionals to share with clients.

It is also the disaster\\nthat families are mostly likely to\\nexperience.  Over 80 percent of all\\nfire deaths occur where people\\nsleep, such as in homes or hotels.\\nMost fires occur when people are\\nlikely to be less alert such as\\nbetween midnight and morning.\\nEighty-four percent of house and\\nbuilding fires are accidental, such\\nas those caused by poor electrical\\nwiring or careless behavior.\\nHowever, 16 percent are set\\nintentionally through arson or acts\\nof terrorism.\\n1. The leading cause of death in a fire is asphyxiation.  Fire\\nvictims seldom see the flames.  Fire consumes the oxygen in\\nthe air, thereby increasing the concentration of deadly car-\\nbon monoxide in the atmosphere.  Inhaling carbon monox-\\nide causes a loss of consciousness or death within minutes.\\n2. The heat from a fire can melt clothes and scorch the\\nlungs in a single breath.  At floor level, temperatures average\\nabout 90 degrees Fahrenheit, but at eye level rise to 600\\ndegrees.\\n3. House fires begin with a bright flame then quickly gen-\\nerate a black, choking smoke.  It is nearly impossible to see\\nthrough a thick cloud of smoke, so fire drill participants\\nshould practice evacuating buildings with their eyes closed.\\nEMERGENCY INFORMATION\\nAccidental fire and explosion can strike anywhere.  Fire fatalities tend to be distributed\\naccording to population density, i.e., those states with the largest populations tend also to\\nhave the greatest number of fire fatalities.',\n",

Proper preparation plus a knowledge of weather conditions can\\nreduce potential harmful effects to you and your family.\\nSevere winter weather can take a number of forms\\n•  Blizzards - A combination of falling, drifting snow and high winds with\\na visibility of less than one km and temperatures below - 10°C.\\n•  Ice Storms - Freezing rain or drizzle that coats roads, trees and hydro\\nlines causing dangerous driving conditions and power failures.\\n•  Heavy Snows - Over 10 cm of snow in 12 hours or 15 cm of snow\\nin less than 24 hours.\\n• Cold Wave - A rapid drop in temperature of 25°C or more in less\\nthan 18 hours.\\nProtective Clothing\\n•  Wear several layers of loose-fitting, light-weight\\nclothing.  This will keep you warmer than a single\\nheavy layer of clothing.  The outer garment should\\nbe tightly woven and water resistant.\\n•  Wear mittens, not gloves, for more warmth\\nand protection.\\n•  Wear a hood or hat.  You lose much of your body\\nheat from the head and face area.\\nTravel Precautions\\nThe best safety precaution during severe weather conditions is to avoid\\ntravelling.  However, if you must drive, be prepared.\\n•  Have your vehicle tuned-up for winter driving and keep your vehicle\\nfull of fuel.\\n•  Plan your trips in advance and drive on well-travelled roads.\\n•  If you plan to go on a trip, tell family or friends of your route, the time\\nyou leave or the time you expect to be at your destination.\\n•  Listen to the radio for weather updates.\\n•  If driving conditions become serious, turn back or stop on the side\\nof the road.\\n•  Carry a winter survival kit.\\nStranded Travellers\\nIf you get trapped in your vehicle, stay with the vehicle, DO NOT panic and\\nremember the following:\\n•  Avoid exposure and overexertion.\\n• Check the exhaust pipe to ensure it is not blocked with snow.\\n• Keep a window partially opened.\\n•  Run the engine sparingly for heat.\\n•  Avoid overuse of headlights as they will wear down the\\nbattery.  Use the interior dome light sparingly at night, as an\\nemergency signal.\\n5',\n",

              " '•  Exercise by moving your arms and legs.\\n•  DO NOT let all occupants sleep at the same time.\\n•  Keep watch for searchers and other traffic.\\nWinter Survival Kit\\nWinter survival kits should include the following:\\n•  Flashlight and extra batteries.\\n•  Candles and coffee tin.\\n•  Matches/lighter.\\n•  Blankets/warm clothing.\\n•  Granola bars, candy, sugar cubes.\\n•  First aid kit.\\n•  Booster cables.\\n•  Shovel and tow rope.\\n•  Flares or other signal aids.\\nHome Precautions\\nSevere weather conditions may result in power failures which will affect your\\nhome heating system.  Anticipate possible heating system failures by preparing\\nthese materials in advance.\\n•  Keep a battery powered radio, flashlight and extra batteries.  The\\nradio and flashlight should use the same size batteries.\\n•  Keep a supply of candles and matches on hand.\\n•  Keep adequate food stocks and medical supplies on hand.\\n•  Have a CSA-approved alternate heat source.\\n• If you have a stove or fireplace, have the chimney cleaned at least\\nonce a year.\\n•  Check your home fuel supplies such as wood, heating oil, kerosene,\\netc.  DO NOT store liquid fuels in the house.\\nHeating System Failure Precautions\\nIf your heating system fails, take these precautions:\\n•  Stay calm - your house will keep you warm for several hours.\\n•  Avoid opening doors unnecessarily.\\n•  During a power failure, turn off all electrical appliances.\\n•  Begin using your alternate heating unit before the house cools down.\\n•\\nIf freezing is possible, turn off the main water valve, drain the water\\nlines and put antifreeze in toilet bowl, sink and bath drains.  The hot\\nwater heater should also be turned off and drained.\\n•  Check operator manuals of major appliances for frost protection\\nrequirements.\\n•  Listen to the radio for emergency instructions.\\nIf You Have Pets\\n•  Keep extra food/feed on hand.\\n•  Provide shelter for animals, especially young and small animals or pets.\\n•  Keep the water source flowing.  Most animals die from dehydration\\nbecause the water source was frozen, not from lack of food.  For\\nhousehold pets, keep them inside or in a dry place.\\n6',\n",

              " 'Family Food Storage and Emergency Preparedness  \\nBy Debi D. Koontz \\nI have a strong belief in the importance of family preparedness. In my home we live on our food storage whenever life throws us \\nan unexpected difficulty. We do not think of our storage as only being there in case of some drastic emergency like an earthquake \\nor civic unrest. Using your food storage in your daily life is the only way to be successful in having a complete and efficient \\nsupply on hand for whatever you and your family may be called upon to bear.  \\nI would be the first to admit that I am, by no means, an expert in this area, but I do have an interest, which has prompted me to \\nresearch this topic, and I can share ideas and experiences that I have had. I hope this information will be of some use to someone \\nsomewhere, and that perhaps it may help families prepare in time.  \\nThis booklet is in two parts. The first part are some notes, ideas and hints on all aspects of starting, organizing and using your food \\nstorage. It is beyond the scope of this work to be complete in all areas on this topic, but is simply a starting place with basic \\ninformation.  \\nThe second part is a detailed list of most of the items that should be considered for your storage. I did not simply list each item, but \\ndescribed reasons, uses, advantages or disadvantages about each item. Many item descriptions include information on how best to \\nstore them. Please read through the list and the descriptions and decide which are most important to you and your family. If you \\nare just beginning, it may be wise to prioritize what items you intend to store. The list is divided into three sections: Food; Health \\n& Grooming; and Household & Emergency supplies. Many medical and emergency uses are given for various food items, \\nhowever, if it’s food then it will be listed in the food section, regardless of it’s other uses (medical, emergency, etc.) Each part of \\nthe list is listed in alphabetical order. This booklet covers everything from mild to extreme circumstances.  \\nWhen you read through the list you may be tempted to think, Oh, I want so much! I’ll never do it! Well, take heart. Don’t let fear \\nor doubt overwhelm you. Any storage is better than no storage and even the best storage had to start with a single item. Just begin \\nand then build it as you can. You can do it!  \\nShould anyone reading this wish to contact me please feel free to contact me via e-mail at debidawn@earthlink.net . I would love \\nto hear from you. If you wish to pass the information in this booklet along, that’s fine, but please keep it complete and intact, with \\nmy name attached (for copyright and possible future publication purposes). I appreciate this. So, now, read on and enjoy. I \\nsincerely hope this is of use to you and your loved ones.  \\n   \\n   \\nPart One  \\nComments on Storage and Preparedness \\n*Buy and store what your family eats. You have to be able to eat and use your food storage everyday to be able to rotate it. The \\nbest reason to store what your family eats is that in a time of emergency, if you’ve only stored the basics like wheat, beans, rice, \\netc. and your family’s diet is suddenly changed, (perhaps even at the same time you’re all experiencing stress), you and your \\nfamily’s stomachs and digestive tracts are not going to be cooperative and calm. Times of stress are not the ideal occasion to \\nsuddenly change your whole diet. This is especially true for children.  \\n*Most foods will last longer than many people think, (especially if they have to) if they are stored well. Rotation is the key. Also, \\ncontainers are important. Nearly everything must be kept dry and airtight. Temperature is important, and is often the determining \\nfactor in the shelf life of many foods. Cool is better that warm. Dry is much better than damp. Insects must be kept under control. \\nOpen containers invite pests to come and make themselves at home.  \\n*Don’t panic when you think of all you need and want to store. It won’t happen overnight. You should plan your storage as a \\nfamily and set priorities for storing what you feel is most important first. You can supplement it as time goes by, for as long as you \\nare able to. Sometimes it may require sacrifice from your family. It’s up to you to decide how much you want to invest. There’s no \\nwrong way. Any storage is better than none, and every little addition is great.  \\n*A simple, almost painless way to build your food storage is to just buy extra products every time you go to the store. Whenever \\nyou buy something, buy two. When something’s on sale, buy the limit. If there is no limit and you can afford it, stock up.',\n",
              " '*Your storage should be kept in a dry, clean, cool and hopefully pest-free, and organized place in your home. If you have not \\norganized your storage either on paper or in its set-up, rotation will be difficult. It’s also hard to see how much you have and \\ndecide what you still need. If space is a problem, you may decide to sacrifice a piece or two of furniture (ex. China cupboard, \\npotted plant, spare bed, end table, bedside table, etc.), then put food storage in its place. If it’s impossible to fit all your storage in \\none room in your home, you could break it up (ex.: water storage and camping gear-garage; canned food-kids’ bedroom; first-aid \\nsupplies-bathroom; boxed items-your bedroom; candles, batteries, & other emergency supplies-front room; paper products-\\nbasement). Be sure not to put tempting, easily opened foods in the children’s rooms. The temptation may prove to be too much for \\nthem. However, they need to be taught now the importance and sacred need for the food storage in which you invest.  \\nIf you really find it difficult to find space for storage, be creative. Don’t let the lack of space be your excuse not to prepare. Try \\nunusual places like under the bed, inside coffee tables or end tables, behind the sofa, in empty spaces in drawers and closets, etc. If \\nthis is the method you are forced to use in your home, be very sure you keep a good record of where you’re putting everything. \\nWherever you store, just remember that the temperature must be cool, and it needs to be as dry as possible.  \\n*Besides your food storage and emergency supplies, you should have a separate 72-hour (3 day & 3 night) kit. This should contain \\nthe minimum amount of food, clothes, and water for each family member. 72 hour kits should also include any needed medication, \\nan emergency shelter (a tarp or cheap lightweight tent), a first-aid kit, candles, waterproof matches, pocket knife, flashlight \\nw/batteries, and some kind of blanket, bedding or lightweight sleeping bag. Each kit can be added to as desired, but should be \\nrelatively lightweight and easy to carry. Your 72 hour kits should be packed tightly into backpacks, duffel bags, etc. and should be \\nin an easily accessible location (ex: hall closet, near the front door, garage, tool shed, or the trunk of your car). Be sure to rotate out \\nall food, water and medicine periodically to keep them fresh. This is especially important if your 72 hour kits are stored in an \\noutside storage location (trunk, shed, garage, etc.). Complete kits are available for purchase, but it’s less expensive to put together \\nyour own, with exactly the items you desire to met the needs of your family.  \\n*Remember: Store what you eat, and eat what you store!  \\n(If you think preparedness is not important, imagine what would have happened to Noah and his family if they had put off building \\nthe ark, gathering the animals, and laying in their food and supplies!)  \\n   \\n   \\nPart Two  \\nStorage List: FOOD \\nAlum (white, powdered)- An imperative food item, with medical uses, to store. When sprinkled on an open wound it will draw \\nout infection and any drainage. It will leave the sore disinfected and dry, and will speed healing. (Buy alum in the spice department \\nat your grocery store.)  \\nApplesauce- Whether canned, bottled, homemade, or store-bought, cinnamon flavored or unsweetened, applesauce is very \\nconvenient and nutritious. It has a long storage life if sealed airtight, and can be used in cooking (pancakes, bread, muffins, cake, \\ncookies, and even casseroles). Since it has natural sweetness it can even supplement or replace sugar inmost recipes. The old adage \\n\"an apple a day keeps the doctor away\" aptly applies to applesauce (and apple juice).  \\nBaking Powder- If you’ll be doing baking, you’ll want to have some on hand.  \\nBaking Soda- There are so many uses for baking soda that a boo could be written on it’s uses. It can be used as a deodorant, \\nmouthwash, toothpaste, cleaning and scouring agent, degreaser, and a natural deodorizer. It has leavening properties and can be \\nmixed with cream of tarter to make baking powder. 1/2 tsp. mixed in a 4-oz. glass of water is good for upset stomachs (remember \\nbicarbonate of soda?). In laundry it’s good as cleaner and water softener. It also makes soaps stretch farther. It can be used as a \\ncoolant for the skin, especially for sunburn, rash, bee-sting, poison ivy and oak. Helps maintain pH in water. Baking soda can be \\nused safely without polluting the ground water. It also makes a great fire extinguisher.  \\nBasil- Excellent seasoning for all foods and dishes. Stores well in airtight containers. Basil tea taken hot stops vomiting and eases \\nstomach cramps. Helpful when applied to snake bites and insect stings. (The tea is made 2 tsp. per hot cup water once a day.)  \\nBeans & Lentils- Excellent and important storage item. Even when stored so long that they get quite hard, simply soak them for a \\nlittle longer before using. Put ginger in the water while soaking beans to lessen problems with gas. Beans are a great source of',\n",
              " 'protein. Cooks well over a campfire if soaked before cooking. When sprouted, their nutritional value increases greatly and offers \\ninexpensive, year-round fresh greens too add to your diet.  \\nBeef Jerky- or other cured smoked meat needs no refrigeration and tastes as good as it is convenient, while offering important \\nprotein.  \\nBlack Pepper- Convenient, versatile seasoning. Stretches a long way.  \\nBottled Salad Dressing- Your favorite flavor will be a good way to eat sprouts (if you’ve discovered the benefits and ease of \\nsprouting your grains, beans, legumes and lentils). When sprouts and dressing are joined by canned or fresh vegetables, you have a \\nfiber-rich, nutritious salad.  \\nBullion Cubes- Great for broth to feed an invalid or sick person. Good to use as a base for any soup. Simply add any vegetable, \\ngrain, meat, pasta, etc. Can be used to make gravy, or r in the water while boiling rice. Stores well in airtight container.  \\nCandy- A special treat now will become an even more special treat in time of emergency when luxuries are scarce. Wouldn’t it be \\nnice to have candy to give a child on their birthday if they had no other gift? Candy also offers a quick burst of energy because of \\nthe high sugar content. Candy could well be one of the more popular items for barter (as would soda pop). Luxury items usually \\nare. Most candy will store for a fairly long time (though it may lose color, flavor or texture slightly), if kept absolutely airtight, \\ncool and especially DRY. Individually wrapped candy is better than soft. If you decide too store candy be very cautious about \\nleaving any open for any length of time. It’s an invitation to ants and other insects.  \\nCanned Foods- Stores for a very long time. Try to keep dry and undented. Bulging cans must be thrown away. Rotation is very \\nimportant. Many canned foods are complete meals and don’t require other foods to complete. Be sure to have at least one manual \\ncan opener. A good variety of canned foods are a smart foundation to your food storage. Examples of canned foods you may want \\nto consider storing are:  \\nSoup  \\nStew  \\nFruit  \\nVegetables  \\nJuice  \\nPasta (ravioli, spaghetti, etc.)  \\nSpam  \\nEvaporated milk  \\nSweetened condensed milk  \\nChili  \\nPork and beans  \\nMeat (turkey, chicken, etc.)  \\nTuna \\nCinnamon- Yummy added to oatmeal, bread, wheat, cereal, cookies, hot chocolate, etc.  \\nCold Cereal- In it’s sealed package, in a dry place, most cold cereals will store 1 to 2 years. Besides being eaten with milk for \\nbreakfast, some kinds of cereal make handy, nutritious snacks straight from the box. It’s very important to use and rotate your \\nstorage of cold cereals. This will provide you with maximum freshness for the longest period of time.',\n",
              " 'Condiments- These are important to store for your own use as well as use for possible barter. These are the often-overlooked \\nitems, which will make a big difference when you are dependent on your food storage. Important examples:  \\nMustard  \\nRelish  \\nMayonnaise (rotate!)  \\nHorseradish  \\nSteak sauce  \\nKetchup  \\nBarbecue sauce  \\nSoy sauce  \\nTabasco/hot sauce  \\nSalsa \\nCorn Meal- Healthy, tasty, and versatile. Can be used for fry batter, bread, pone, muffins, cornbread, and pancakes.  \\nCorn Starch- Cornstarch can be used in place of talcum or baby powder. Great for diaper rash and other rashes. Absorbs moisture. \\nGreat for cooking. Used as a thickener with simple broth to make gravy. Also will stretch soup and thicken it. It has carbohydrates \\nto provide energy.  \\nDehydrated and/or Freeze-Dried Foods- These are the foods with the moisture removed. This allows for extremely long storage. \\nThese are convenient and lightweight to carry, and are easy to prepare. Water rehydrates them. Flavor is retained, and it takes \\nmuch less space to store per serving than other food storage items because the process shrinks the food to 1/8 to 1/7 their normal \\nsize. They don’t need to packed in space consuming water like canned foods. (Often, though, the \"water\" from canned foods can \\nbe used.) You can dehydrate foods yourself in your oven (lowest setting, door ajar), or in the sun at temperatures of at least 110 \\ndegrees. The process takes an average of about 18 hours. Turn the layer of food occasionally during process.  \\nDried or Ramen Soup- Complete, nutritious, lightweight, and easy to prepare. Requires only hot water. Stores for a very long \\ntime because there is no moisture in it. (which is what limits the shelf life of some foods).  \\nFlavorings- Vanilla, almond, and maple are the most common and useful, though others (orange, lemon, etc.) can be included to \\nsuit your families preferences. These could one day be handy when creativity with your food supply has you trying to make new \\nand different foods.  \\nFlour- Many uses!! Thin flour water (plus dash salt) batter will make tortillas. (Fry on both sides dry or in oil.) Flour can also be \\nused as a thickener. Be sure to ROTATE. It can be stored in the freezer for longer storage but needs to be kept dry. Flour can help \\nblood clot on small wounds. (Put a handful over wound and hold firmly with hand until blood flow stops. If you add salt or alum \\ninto the flour, it will help disinfect.)  \\nGatorade/Sports Drink- These drinks can restore vital minerals and nutrients and prevent dehydration (which can be fatal). Their \\nshelf life is fairly long unopened.  \\nGinger- Powdered or gingerroot. Made into a tea it can be used as a decongestant (like hot mustard plaster, but better because it \\nwon’t burn the skin). Just immerse a towel, rag or old shirt in a strong, heated ginger tea and place on chest to loosen chest \\ncongestion. It causes heat even after it’s cooled, though it can be re-rinsed in the warm tea. A milder tea can be drunk for upset \\nstomach and gas. Ginger in the water of beans as they soak will control gas problems. Ginger is a good spice to add to any cooked \\nvegetable. It’s often used in Chinese cooking.',\n",
              " 'Hard Red Winter Wheat- Of all grains this stores the longest. It can be sprouted to provide you with fresh greens, even with \\nlimited water. It can be ground, coarse or fine, to make flour. It can be added whole to soups (or ground, as a thickener). It can also \\nbe cooked and served as hot cereal. Wheat is rich in iron and vitamin E. When storing grains like wheat you should also get some \\nkind of grinder or handmill.  \\nHoney- Every food storage must have honey. It will last forever. Honey, which was found in the tombs of the Egyptian pharaohs, \\nstill had it’s beneficial properties. Honey can be used in place of sugar as a sweetener. It’s sweeter than sugar is so use it at a rate \\nof ½ the amount you would sugar. When honey crystallizes simply melt it in hot water (rotate/turn/shake during process). Honey, \\nused on open cuts, will provide a protective covering and will disinfect (though it’s sticky). Honey also helps coat sore throats.  \\nHot Cereal- Though you can use your stores of oats and wheat to make hot cereal, there’s advantages in storing pre-packaged, \\ncommercial brands. They store well and are very convenient. It’s especially nice to store a favorite of your family. (ex.: Malt-O-\\nMeal, Cream of Wheat, Maypo, etc.)  \\nInstant Hot Chocolate- A nice treat, quick energy and very convenient at home or when camping. It can also be a source of \\nwarmth on cold mornings. Baking cocoa powder can be stored too, but it requires more ingredients to use it to make hot chocolate \\n(but it certainly does have many uses in baking that make it a good item for your storage).  \\nInstant Mashed Potatoes- A convenient source of the nutrients in potatoes. It will store a very long time. The better the \\npackaging, the longer its shelf life will be. Canned is better than boxed. Mashed potatoes leave stomachs feeling full faster than \\nmost foods, which is an advantage when trying to stretch your food storage.  \\nJell-O- This product offers a way to cover the taste of chemically treated water. It can be added to with canned, fresh or \\ndehydrated fruit. Jell can also help relieve diarrhea symptoms. To do this prepare jell as directed with just slightly more water than \\nnormal. Then drink the jell water while still warm, like tea. This will also provide necessary liquid to avoid dehydration, which is a \\nbig danger of diarrhea.  \\nJelly & Jam- Stores well. Easy topping for pancakes, tortillas, crackers, and all bread items. Adds flavor and sweetness to bland \\nfoods. Can be added in small amounts to cake or cookie recipes for extra zing, or for a sweet, fruity flavor if used in place of sugar.  \\nJuice- (canned/bottled/boxed/frozen/powdered) An essential storage item. Quick, convenient and very nutritious. Adding a variety \\nof flavors is good addition to your food storage. Juice can be used as a snack or small meal in and of itself. It can be used in cooing \\nin place of other liquids in many recipes. Apple juice can be poured over cold cereal or granola in place of milk. Tomato juice can \\nbe used in cooking meat or pasta. Tomato juice or vegetable juice makes an excellent base for soups and stews.  \\nKool-aid- This is another item that will help the water taste better when it’s been chemically treated. It’s also a nice addition to \\npancake batter or muffins to add a sweet fruity flavor. It contains vitamin C, which is an important one because the body is unable \\nto store it and therefore it must always be replenished. If you store the unsweetened kind (which is much cheaper and compact), be \\nsure you have sugar stored (or sweeten it with honey). You may prefer to store the kind that already has the sugar added because it \\nis so convenient. There are alternate versions of Kool-aid that contain less sugar, and are already sweetened (ex. Crystal Light). \\nFor all of these, however, you absolutely must keep them dry. It is important that they remain airtight as well, so it may be a good \\nidea to keep them dry, airtight, and organized for easy access and the ability to rotate, by putting them into a plastic container \\n(Tupperware, Rubbermaid, etc.).  \\nMarshmallows- These can be eaten even if they get dried out (which just makes them crunchy). Toasted marshmallows are the \\nhighlight of camping. They can be used when cooking yams and pumpkin. They’re also good right out of the bag for energy. Kids \\nlove them. Used in making \"cereal treats\" (ex. Rice Krispie treats- though most cereals will work). They should be fresh (not dried \\nout) though to be used this way. A handful added to Jell, during preparation, is also a nice treat.  \\nM.R.E.’s- (Meals Ready To Eat) Good for 72 hour kits. Compact, complete, healthy, lightweight, and convenient. Needs no \\nrefrigeration, and can even be eaten unheated if necessary. But they are expensive!  \\nNutmeg- Should be used SPARINGLY only. Good sprinkled on hot chocolate and eggnog. Can settle stomachs, nausea, and \\nvomiting. Also can be used as an expectorant. Helps improve appetite and digestion. Good for helping maintain a healthy intestinal \\ntract. In boiling water it can be used as a deodorizer. A good seasoning to add to bland dishes. But remember to use it sparingly, \\ndon’t over do it.  \\nOats- Excellent source of bran and fiber. Popular cookie ingredient. Can be added to meat loaf. Makes nutritious and filling hot \\ncereal. (Added nutmeg, cinnamon, raisins, or dehydrated fruit makes it even tastier.) Can be used to make pancakes. Oatmeal \\nbaths, masks, and soap are healthy for skin and good for itches and rashes.',\n",
              " 'Oil/Crisco Shortening- Very useful and important, especially when cooking over a campfire or using food storage basics. Butter \\nflavor Crisco can be used in recipes in place of margarine is you have none stored (though powdered butter/margarine is \\navailable). Use slightly less Crisco than the recipes call for. Ideas of recipes that this replacement can occur are things like \\nmacaroni and cheese, many casseroles, and definitely cookies. Oil is used in making bread, tortillas and crackers. Can be used to \\nmake a dressing over sprouts and fresh vegetables. Be sure to rotate. You must do this with these items particularly. It’s necessary \\nto have oil on hand to season cast iron skillets.  \\nPackaged Dinners- Examples: Tuna or Hamburger Helper, Noodle Roni, and boxed Macaroni and Cheese. These have both \\nadvantages and disadvantages. The negative points are that they usually take up a lot of space per serving over other storage foods. \\nAlso, you usually need other foods to prepare them such as milk, margarine or even meat. But if you’ve got butter powder or \\nbutter-flavored Crisco and canned or powdered milk, these can be very convenient. (Meat can be omitted or substituted). They are \\ngood because flavors (cheese, etc.) and spices are already added. Everything’s pre-cut and pre-measured (though additional pasta, \\nrice, etc. will stretch the number of servings without drastically affecting taste or consistency). You can also add any canned or \\ndehydrated meat to make it a complete, balanced one-dish meal.  \\nPancake Mix- Yummy, quick to make (the best kind to store is the ones that require only water to be added). Be sure to have a \\ngood skillet to cook the on. Store completely dry and airtight in cool place. (Muffin Mixes are similar and also a good storage \\nitem, but once again, be sure to store ones that need only water to be added unless you have the other needed ingredients stored as \\nwell.)  \\nParsley- Fresh or dried. Parsley is rich in vitamin C and in iron, calcium, potassium and vitamin A. Prevents urinary infections. \\nGood for fevers. Excellent for prevention of, or maintenance of, cancer. Cures sting from insect bites when used in a poultice. A \\ntea made from the seeds can be used as a shampoo to kill vermin in the hair. Helps aid digestion (which is the original thought \\nbehind sprigs of parsley being placed on dinner plates in restaurants). Excellent addition to soups, salads, coleslaw, potato salad, \\ncasseroles, on meat, or cooked into scrambled eggs.  \\nPasta- Some regions have an easier time than others storing pasta do. All pasta, however, will be usable stored for long periods of \\ntime IF kept cool (to avoid insects like weevils), dry and completely AIRTIGHT. Simply add any number of food storage items to \\ncooked pasta. For instance, things like powdered cheese; cut-up meat product; spaghetti sauce; vegetables; soup; canned milk; \\npowdered butter, etc. Cooked pasta can be eaten cold or hot. Often, leftover pasta dishes can be fried in a skillet (even over a \\ncampfire), either plain, or with added scrambled eggs.  \\nPeanut Butter- Excellent source of protein and quick energy. Stores for a very long time unopened. Can be eaten plain or on \\nbread, soda crackers, or tortillas. Travels well and is convenient because it doesn’t need to be cooked or refrigerated. One teaspoon \\nper day gives needed protein.  \\nPop Tarts- These handy food items are surprisingly nutritious and extremely convenient. They can be eaten cold, like a food bar. \\nOr they can be heated in toaster or oven. While camping, they can be heated on a grill or even on a heated rock near a fire.  \\nPowdered Butter- A good item to have on hand with innumerable uses.  \\nPowdered Cheese- Great to add to pasta or eggs. Makes a good base for a vegetable & cheese soup. Makes easy casseroles. Easily \\nstored dairy item.  \\nPowdered Eggs- Stores for an extremely long time if kept in an air-tight container. Add to recipes in place of eggs. Makes \\nscrambled eggs and omelets. Added to leftover pasta (especially mac & cheese) with a little water and/or oil, and fried, makes a \\nyummy meal.  \\nPowdered Milk- Must have water to mix with it. Store in an air-tight container in a cool/dry place. Must be used and rotated \\nregularly. Serve it to your family now (plain or mixed with regular milk) to get them accustomed to it. It is a critical item of your \\nstorage because it’s needed to use with so many other foods and dishes. Doctors have said tat most people could live healthfully \\nfor a month or two on powdered milk alone!  \\nPudding- (boxed mix) With adequate cooling or refrigeration, pudding is a nice treat and a good use of your powdered milk. If \\nrefrigeration is a problem, then pudding can be used to make a special treat: \"Quick Shakes\". This is simply unset pudding, but \\ncould be viewed as an energy drink because of the calories and carbohydrates it offers. During stress your family will be happy to \\nget such a yummy surprise. It does also offer protein and vitamins. Evaporated milk may also be used (water should be used to \\ndilute the evaporated milk first, however, because it is so rich). Pudding can also be used in baking delicious cakes, cookies or \\npancakes, by simply using it to replace an equal amount of flour in the recipe. This adds a rich texture and flavor.',\n",
              " 'Rice- Must be stored in a cool and air-tight container. It’s filling and healthy. Water used to cook rice can be saved to drink or use \\nin cooking (it’s high in vitamin B). Rice can be cooked in clear broth to add flavor. It can also be added to soups. To make rice \\npudding simply add sugar, milk, butter and vanilla. (More things can be added to your taste). Rice can be cooked many ways: \\nsteamed fried or boiled. It can be made into a hot cereal. Added vegetables and/or meat make a complete meal. Any spice will add \\nvariety (ex.: spanish rice, curried rice, etc.)  \\nSalt- In ancient times salt was highly valued. Nowadays this inexpensive item is an excellent addition to your food storage for \\nyour own use and for future barter needs. Salt is very versatile. It can be used to cure meat, add flavor to otherwise bland foods, \\nand can be used to help ease the pain of sores. It will speed healing (try it on a canker sore). Apply the salt straight on the wound \\n(it sometimes stings initially), or dilute it with water. ½ tsp. in warm water is good for headaches and indigestion.  \\nSage- Good seasoning for roasts, soups, etc. Can be used as a cure-all. A strong sage tea is an excellent gargle for tonsillitis or \\nulcers in the throat or mouth (good mixed with lemon and honey). The sage tea can be drunk cold or hot. It’s one of the best \\nremedies for gas, liver, stomach, kidney or bowel trouble. Will stop bleeding and is good used to clean old wounds and ulcers. And \\nwound will heal more quickly when washed with a sage tea. It’s useful for typhoid and scarlet fever, measles and smallpox. \\nSoothes nerves and relieves headaches. An effective hair tonic (will make hair grow if roots haven’t been destroyed), and will \\nremove dandruff. When used in high quantities sage is good for easing female problems, and all lung problems (colds, asthma, \\ncoughs, bronchitis, influenza and pneumonia). Tea from sage should be steeped (while covered), not boiled.  \\nSoda Crackers- These have a longer shelf life than you might think. The key is to keep them absolutely dry, and of course, air-\\ntight. If they so get soft and stale, it takes only a few minutes to \"re-crisp\" them in the oven. Soda crackers are a bread item in your \\ndiet and can even be eaten like sandwiches, topped with tuna salad, meat & cheese, or peanut butter and jelly (it’s good, try it!). \\nSoda crackers can also help alleviate queasiness. They provide the body with salt, and are a good addition to a meal of coup, stew \\nor chili.  \\nSpaghetti Sauce- This makes a quick, easy meal out of any pasta item. Vegetables, powdered cheese, meat, or spices can be added \\nto it to taste.  \\nSpices- If there are spices that you frequently use, it is a good idea to add them to your food storage so that you are able to \\ncontinue to \"spice up\" your cooking.  \\nSplit Peas- These last a long time because they’ve had the moisture removed. Makes good soup. (add enough spices and seasoning \\nto suit the taste preferences of your family. Meat and onion and carrots are also good additions.)  \\nSugar- It’s important to keep sugar cool and very dry, but it’s an important part of any food storage. Also be careful to watch out \\nfor ants or insects. If the sugar gets hard it can be chipped or grated and then used with no problem as long as it’s unpolluted with \\nanything. Sugar may be highly prized one day, but remember that honey can also be used as a sweetener at a ratio of half that of \\nsugar. Brown sugar and powdered sugar may be stored as well for their many different uses. Brown sugar is delicious when added \\nto beans, wheat cereal, cookies, and is often used in bread, canning and preserving recipes.  \\nSyrup- Though syrup can be made with water, sugar and maple flavoring, it’s very convenient to have some pre-made syrup on \\nhand. It’s better to buy it in small containers so you can use it up in just one or two meals so you don’t have an opened bottle \\ninviting pests (especially if there’s no refrigeration). Yummy when added to pork and beans.  \\nVelveeta- This product doesn’t need to be refrigerated when it’s unopened and stores fairly long. It’s good added to many dishes, \\nmelted over bread, tortillas or crackers, or eaten plain. It’s a great source of vitamins from the dairy food group.  \\nVinegar- When mixed with honey it’s a cur-all. It can be used as an astringent. It’s a wonderful glass cleaner. It’s used in cooing \\nas a preservative (to pickle-when used with salt and water).  \\nWhole Cloves- These are used in cooking meat (like ham), and pickling and preserving. It adds flavoring to fruits, soups and \\nstews. One or two cloves added to lemonade \"spices\" it up. (Most people do not like to eat the cloves, only use it as a \\nspice/seasoning agent.) Whole cloves can be used directly on toothaches to help relieve pain. One clove can freshen breath after \\nonly a few minutes in the mouth. A few can be added to the water of vegetables while they are cooking. Several cloves in a pan of \\nhot water is an effective air freshener (added citrus peel and a cinnamon stick makes it even more aromatic-especially during the \\nholiday season).  \\n(*If you have access to freezer space, it offers you a wonderful opportunity to store meat, cheese, margarine, and many other great \\nfood items. Remember to rotate things as you use/buy them. I, myself, have a large freezer full of food, which I use and have \\nstored. However, it’s extremely important that your ENTIRE food storage is NOT frozen, to prevent the loss of your complete',\n",
              " 'supply if power is lost).  \\n   \\n   \\nStorage List: Health & Grooming \\nAntibiotic Ointment- (ex. Neosporin) Speeds healing. Reduces the risk of injuries becoming more severe from infection. Should \\nbe included in first aid kits, 72 hour kits, and a good supply should be included in your storage.  \\nAspirin/Tylenol/Aleve- An absolute MUST! One day it could be your entire pain-killing \"pharmacy\" in a bottle. This may make \\nthe difference of pain being bearable or not, for you or a family member. Check expiration dates and rotate as you use it.  \\nBaby Powder/Body Powder- Powder, in olden days, was found in great quantities in all the best boudoirs all over the world. This \\nwas because they knew it’s advantages in absorbing moisture, controlling odor, and leaving one feeling fresh and dry. That way of \\nthinking may one day be well emulated if the water and opportunity to wash is restricted. But remember that the need to wash is \\nstill very important to hygiene and sanitation. So, even if it’s greatly reduced due to water shortage, it should never be replaced \\ncompletely.  \\nBand-Aids/Bandages/Sterile Gauze Pads- A must to have on hand. They will probably be used quickly so store a lot.  \\nBar Soap- You can never store too much. The milder the better. Heavily perfumed or deodorant soap may leave a residue or cause \\na rash if inadequate water for rinsing is available. Though you should also store some anti-bacterial and/or surgical soap.  \\nCalamine Lotion- A good item too have on hand when living at the mercy of mosquitoes, poison ivy, and other skin irritations. \\nYou’ll be happy you have this someday, either for yourself or for a family member.  \\nDeodorant- Imagine working hard for your family’s survival, sweating profusely, then being unable to shower or wash very often! \\nOr even being able to change into a limitless supply of clothes. You, and those around you, might appreciate having a supply of \\ndeodorant.  \\nDiarrhea Control Medicine- (such as Imodium AD) In difficult or stressful circumstances, diarrhea can be a serious problem. \\nEspecially when there might be tainted food or water supplies. Diarrhea, left unchecked, can cause dehydration, even death. This, \\nand all types of medicine, needs to be rotated according to expiration dates.  \\nHydrogen Peroxide- (and rubbing Alcohol) An excellent source of disinfecting. This item could mean the ability to avoid a severe \\ninfection. Besides being used directly on wounds it can also be used to disinfect surfaces (bathroom sinks and counters, and \\nneedles to take out slivers).  \\nLotion- When working hard, this will be a luxury item.  \\nMisc. First-Aid & Medical Supplies- Take your pick from these following examples of important medical supplies:  \\nAce bandages  \\nAntacid  \\nAnti-histamine/decongestant  \\nBandage tape  \\nBlack silk thread (for stitches)  \\nClean scissors (or clean razor blades)  \\nCotton balls  \\nCough syrup or drops',\n",
              " 'Disposable gloves  \\nEpsom salt  \\nFirst-Aid book  \\nHot water bottle  \\nIce packs  \\nLaxatives  \\nMedication to induce vomiting  \\nQ-tips  \\nSheets (for bandages and slings)  \\nSmelling salts  \\nSplints  \\nSterile needles  \\nThermometer  \\nToothache/canker sore medicine  \\nTweezers  \\nVaseline \\nPrescription & Other Medications- These should be stored as far in advance as possible for all family members with special \\nneeds (ex.: heart problems, asthma, epilepsy, diabetes, menstrual problems, etc.). Check expiration dates periodically and rotate as \\nyou use it.  \\nRazors/Shaving Cream- If you don’t plan to be excessively hairy, you’ll need to have a supply of shaving supplies. Don’t forget, \\nan electric razor won’t be good for very much without electricity.  \\nSanitary Napkins/Tampons- These might be overlooked, but be careful not to. Don’t forget growing daughters too.  \\nShampoo & Conditioner- Plan a \"head\".  \\nToothpaste- You’ll be glad you have it. Even of you don’t have a toothbrush and have to use your finger. Remember, it may one \\nday be very hard to find a dentist. Storing spare Toothbrushes, as well as Dental floss, is a good idea also.  \\n   \\n   \\nStorage List: Household & Emergency Supplies \\nAir Mattress/Cot/Ground Pad- If you’re positive that you wouldn’t be able to sleep with a rock in your back on the cold, hard \\nground, then now is the time to prepare. These items could one day be your bed during an emergency, and would be a real luxury. \\nPatch kits are available to keep air mattresses usable. In the meantime, these items are handy for unexpected guests.  \\nBaby items- If you’re expecting, or prone to get pregnant easily items such as formula, cloth diapers, baby clothes, baby food, and \\nbottles could be a blessing to have on hand. If you do not need these items after all, they would be excellent for use as barter to',\n",
              " 'families who find themselves in this unexpected situation. For deliveries it’s good to supply items like sterile scissors, strong silk \\nthread, surgical soap, a nasal aspirator, etc.  \\nBatteries- If you’re clever enough to store battery operated radios, lamps, flashlights and so on, you’ll never have too many \\nbatteries. Be sure to rotate them now, on an ongoing basis, as you use them. They can be stored in the refrigerator. Keep track of \\nwhere batteries are in your home (remote control, clock, etc.) so you can use them if you run out during an emergency. \\nRechargeable batteries should not be your entire store because if there’s no power, then you will soon be out of luck.  \\nBlankets- Native Americans used blankets as barter. Pioneers used blankets as heirlooms and wedding gifts. Hours were spent \\nhand-stitching quilts. As blankets became tattered and worn they were put to good use as doors, rugs, tablecloths, and were made \\ninto coats. I don’t think, as you become prepared for whatever lies ahead, that you could ever have too many blankets. Especially if \\nthey are sturdy and warm. Just imagine how appreciate you would before each and every blanket on a freezing night, especially if \\nyou and your children are sleeping without electricity or even outside. If you did end up with too many blankets, there would be a \\ndemand for them I’m sure.  \\nBleach- This is an inexpensive storage item that is quite valuable. It can help you have a purified water supply, clean clothes, and \\ndisinfect almost anything. Don’t buy a more expensive name brand. Bleach is bleach. Also, avoid bleach with a fragrance added.  \\nBug Spray/Insect Repellent- These may one day be your only line of defense against those pests who often carry diseases. \\nMosquito netting may be a good investment as well.  \\nCamp Shovel/Hatchet/Hammer/Saw/Axe- If you are living in the great outdoors, or in reduced circumstances, you’ll need the \\ntools to help you survive. Digging latrines or cooking pits, chopping wood, setting up tents and clotheslines may be daily activities \\nsome time in the future. Even id you’re living in your home, but are unable to use the toilet because of lack of water, you’ll need to \\ndig a substitute one.  \\nCast Iron Skillet/Dutch Oven- Skillets work really well over a campfire if they are seasoned. They retain heat and cook evenly.  \\nCandles- Quick and easy to use. Portable. Takes no batteries, kerosene or electricity. Be sure to store candleholders too! \\nSmokeless, dripless tapers are nice, but big, wide candles last longer. Votive candles aren’t as good because they don’t last very \\nlong.  \\nClothes- Sturdy, well-made clothes for all seasons are important to have for each member of the family. If you have growing \\nchildren be prepared with sizes to accommodate their growth. Remember that fashion will not matter. Quality and fit will mean \\nmuch more. Thick socks and sturdy shoes are excellent to have. Extra pairs might want to be considered. Work gloves, winter \\ngloves and hats, extra shoelaces, dependable wristwatches, winter coats, warm pajamas, and so on are all very good items to have \\non hand. Be sure to have each item for each member of the family.  \\nClothesline/Clothes Pins- Back to basics. When clothes get wet, or hand washed, you’ll need a way to dry them to prevent mold \\nfor forming. Clotheslines can also make temporary shelters with sheets, blankets, tarps, and tablecloths draped over them.  \\nDish Pans & Dish Drainers- Most of us have been spoiled by automatic dishwasher and don’t’ have these useful things on hand. \\nThese will become important to having clean, sanitary dishes and pots and pans if you are without power. Also, if water is in short \\nsupply, the dish-panful of water would have to last. These can be used indoors or out. They don’t cost a lot, so they are a good \\ninvestment.  \\nGarden Seeds- Be sure to store non-hybrid seeds to get the maximum amount of harvest after the first year. Store seeds in a dry \\nplace. Growing your own fresh produce is a wonderful addition to a stored diet and allows you to survive on a more permanent \\nbasis. Make sure to store enough extra water to keep your garden growing through dry times. Never water your garden in the heat \\nand light of mid-day. Include herbs in your garden. They add flavor to all meals and often have medicinal qualities.  \\nGrinder or Hand Mill- This is a necessary item to have to grind wheat or other grains, into flour or meal, if you have them in \\nyour food storage. Though expensive, electric grinders are easy and fast. Hand mills are good when there’s no electricity.  \\nKerosene- Return to the old days. What worked for your grandparents will work for you. Kerosene stored for a long time. Be sure \\nto keep it upright. If you store kerosene, make sure you have lamps to use with it, and visa-versa.  \\nLiquid Dish Soap- Versatile product. Besides washing dishes, it can wash clothes, camping gear, shoes, floors, and hands.',\n",
              " 'Lysol- (or other disinfecting spray) This is a great way to control germs (& odors) which can cause disease. Great caution must be \\ntaken, however, not to get any on food or food preparation areas, or where children or pets could get it into their hands (or paws) or \\nin their mouths.  \\nMatches- Long-handled fireplace matches are great. Also any wood match is good. They should be stored in watertight containers. \\nFlint, fire-starting stones are very handy with limitless uses. You should also try to store at least some waterproof matches. These \\nare good in 72-hour kits.  \\nMeans of Mobility- Be creative. Bicycles, wheelbarrows, handcarts, wagons, etc. You need to think ahead of what you might use \\nto transport yourself and your supplies in an emergency situation. You may want to store repair supplies like extra inner tubes, tire \\npatch kit, etc.  \\nPaper Plates/Cups/Bowls & Plastic Utensils- When water becomes scarce, and sanitation is a problem, these will be extremely \\nimportant to you. The best and least expensive plates to store are the cheap, plain white ones sold in packages of 100 or more, \\noften for less than a dollar. They take up little space and when used with re-usable plate holders they’re stronger than the bulkier, \\nmore expensive styrofoam plates.  \\nPaper Towels- These can be used as disposable towels, tissues, napkins, wash cloths, and toilet paper. Well worth the effort to \\nsave them.  \\nPencils/Pens & Paper- These will become more valuable and appreciated as access to them stops. You will want to be able write \\njournals, recipes, notes, and reminders. If you find yourself home-schooling your children, paper and pencils would be invaluable. \\n(Books too.)  \\nPet Food- If Rover or Fluffy are important members of the family don’t forget to store food for them. Be sure to use and rotate, \\nespecially dry food. Canned pet food stores quite a long time. Pets can also live on many regular food items you might have stored \\n(especially if they’re hungry). Even beef or chicken broth. Though they may help the rodent population by supplementing their \\ndiet themselves.  \\nPlastic Wrap/ Foil/ Wax Paper/Trash Bags/Ziplock Bags- Important items for food preparation and storage. Only unscented \\nclear or white trash bags should be used to hold unwrapped food. All trash bags make good ground cover, emergency ponchos, \\nequipment cover, and makeshift shelters. Foil is great for cooking in, or over, a campfire. Ziplock bags are versatile for holding \\nfood, matches, candles, first-aid supplies, even a dry pair of socks. Wax paper is good for food preparation work space.  \\nPocket Knife/Hunting Knife- Let your imagination tell you all the reasons why these are critical emergency storage items.  \\nRadio- (Short-wave or transistor) Be sure it runs without electricity and is portable. A simple antenna is an added investment. This \\ncould be your link to the outside world in case of emergency.  \\nRope/Nylon Cord- This may turn out to be one of your most valuable supplies. Uses include everything from creating shelter, to \\nemergency rescue, to a creative outdoor shower or latrine.  \\nSafety Pins- Whether living in your home, or in the open, safety pins have limitless uses from clothing repair to first aid.  \\nScrub Brush/Broom/Bucket/Mop- Cleanliness and sanitation may one day be very important to keep you and your family \\nhealthy, as well as comfortable. Even living in a tent, a broom will be handy to keep the floor of the tent clean and dry. A simple \\ntwig, when stepped on, can cause a rip in the tent fabric. How much easier to sweep it out than to worry about repairing your tent.  \\nSewing Kit- The size and contents are up to you. For instance, if you have stored fabric you’ll need plenty of thread. But every \\nhousehold will need a sewing kit of some kind to keep clothes, blankets and towels in good repair. A smaller version is ideal for \\n72-hour kits.  \\nTarp- This is another versatile item. The more you have on hand, the more you’ll find uses for. A few ideas are: a ground cover, a \\nshower, a tent, as well as means of protecting your firewood and supplies.  \\nToilet Paper- Do I even need to say how very important you might one day find this item to be? It could be quite valuable, in fact. \\nI know that I would much prefer it over leaves and dirty scraps of paper. It will store forever if you keep it dry.',\n",
              " 'Towels- When you can’t do a load of laundry every day, and you and your family are trying to stay clean and dry, and when you \\nare trying to keep pots and pans and dishes clean, you will treasure every single towel you posses. Especially if you lose or ruin \\nany and are unable to replace them. Towels also make good throw rugs when living in a tent.  \\nTravel Game/Deck of Cards- If you had no TV, movies, video games or libraries at your disposal, how much would you and \\nyour children appreciate a diversionary activity? Put a couple in your 72-hour kits. These items could be invaluable to keep \\nchildren occupied while you are busy.  \\nVinyl Tablecloths- These provide more than just a clean eating area. They can be used as blankets, curtains, ground cover, and \\nemergency shelters. They can also be made into raincoats or ponchos. In an emergency, they can be cut down to be placed around \\nfeet by tying a cord around the ankles to keep in place. Shower curtains can be used in similar ways to these tablecloths, though \\nwith less durability, thickness or warmth. Never throw away old shower curtains or vinyl tablecloths. They could still be quite \\nuseful.  \\nWater- This is, without question, the single most important and life-saving item you could store! Besides being necessary to drink, \\nit’s needed to wash clothes and dishes and to bathe in. It will need to be used sparingly because no matter how much you have, \\nyou’ll never know how long you will have to depend on your supply. I fear that long before people would start to panic over \\nfinding food, they will be desperate for water. Water can be stored in glass or plastic containers (except milk containers because \\nthey are biodegradable), and must have an airtight lid. A small piece of plastic wrap placed over the mouth of the container before \\nyou put the lid on helps keep the water fresh. You can use tap water plain if you change it once a year, or add a small amount of \\nbleach or other commercial purification product before storing indefinitely. You can also boil water before using to kill germs and \\nimprove the taste. Try to store your water in a cool place. Don’t overlook the water in your toilet tank and water heater in an \\nunexpected crisis. Waterbed water can be used for washing, but don’t drink it or use it on eating surfaces because of contamination \\ndue to the chemicals used in making the plastic lining.  \\nWater Purification Tablets or Containers/Filter Pumps- An absolute must. These can be life-saving. They can help turn most \\nunusable or questionable water sources into safe drinking water. These are especially vital when living \"on the trail\" or outdoors. \\nBoiling water helps remove the bacteria too.  \\n   \\n(*One last note from the author: I sincerely hope and pray that this information will be of help to someone. I would hope that after \\nreading this you would not feel apprehensive or scared or negative. We are told that the righteous need not fear, and preparation, \\nin any form or amount, can certainly offer plenty of assurance and confidence. In this work I have presented all kinds of uses in all \\ntypes of situations, mild and extreme, now and in the unknown future. It is not my intention to be someone that stirs up panic or \\nfear. No, in fact, the opposite is the case. I hope that others will incorporate this calmly into their daily lives and continue to live \\nas they are now, with just the added assurance and peace of mind that it can offer them and their families. I wish all of you every \\nhappiness as you set out on this course in whatever way you select. Have fun and good luck!)',\n",

              " '2 \\n\\uf0aeYour Personal & Family E-PAK \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMY MOTHER’S WISDOM \\n \\nI learned about preparedness and survival kits from my mother. She was wisdom personified and \\nalways seemed to know what to do, no matter what the occasion! I truly regret it took me so long to \\nrealize it. As a fledgling Boy Scout––less than a Tenderfoot, actually––the troop was going on a \\nlong-awaited and unprecedented early spring camping trip. At last, I was going to be with the older \\nboys whom I not only admired, but secretly revered. The last thing I wanted was to be embarrassed \\nby being unprepared––heaven forbid, imagine not being prepared at 12 years of age!  \\n \\nWhen I asked Mother what to take on this extended outing, she replied in her soft-spoken manner, \\npractically without a moment’s hesitation, ―You need to wonder what could happen and be willing \\nto pay the wages of wandering in the wilderness. Take some water, Wranglers, weenies, wipes, \\nwarm clothing, weather protection, a weapon, a wayfinder, and whatever, and keep a watchful \\neye...‖  \\n \\nI knew this was going to be ―W‖ formula, no doubt! Let me elaborate on her method of guidance. \\nShe had taught me everything in the world operated on a formula. The only other ―W‖ formula she \\nhad told me was, ―Working will win when wishing won’t!‖ \\n \\nEvaluate these ―W‖ formula preparedness pointers in relationship to your own emergency and dis-\\naster preparedness efforts. \\n \\nWonder: determine, by some serious thinking, what problems might occur in the field (or in my \\nlife), such as: \\n– To which wonders of Nature I’d be vulnerable,  \\n– What some other creature––man or beast––might cause me harm, or \\n– Which personal problems I might suffer. \\n \\nI think she wanted me to ponder what experiences I might not be able to control. She wanted me to \\nplan for the worst, hope for the best, and be able to deal eventually with whatever happened. \\n \\nWilling/Wages: meant that I must be willing to pay the price to make this trip––time, effort, and \\nrisk. From the available alternatives, was this most practical, prudent, and provident for me? I had \\nto decide if it was the most ―bang for my buck‖ at that moment—and about the longer-term conse-\\nquences and implications. Even at that early age, I had already become aware of the consequences \\nof being unprepared. Mother was indicating the price I would pay for not being prepared for the \\nfuture eventualities in my life. \\n \\nWander: once departed from her presence, the security I had at home would be unavailable, and it \\nwould be as if I were wandering in the wilderness, all alone. \\n \\nWater: ―Take water,‖ she said. ―You can’t live very long without drinking water––just a few \\nhours without it and you’re in deep trouble! Of course, that’s not necessarily true of taking a bath \\nin times of emergency. But it is one of those things a young boy can learn to do without, at least \\nduring a weekend or an emergency. You can live three days without water, but you get weaker \\nevery hour without it.‖ \\n \\nWranglers: meant having appropriate clothing for the occasion, depending on the environment. In \\nmy youth, jeans (we could afford the name brand Wranglers only after the harvest was in the barn) \\nwere the working-class clothes in our ex-urban community—could be worn for man’s work––and \\ncamping out, too. They were sturdy clothing, long-wearing, tough, and easily maintained. This \\nadmonition was also meant to include a regular change of underwear. (How embarrassing to be \\nwearing dirty underwear in case you were taken to the hospital after a camping accident!) \\n \\nWeenies: meant the need for nourishment. My mother knew my penchant for hot dogs and pork \\nand beans. Her instruction to me was to take food that (1) I would eat even under the stress of be-\\ning away from the well-spread table she always prepared; (2) is easily prepared in the boonies; and \\n(3) I’d normally enjoy. (I would have preferred her homemade oyster stew––but that would have \\nbeen totally impractical for the camping environment––as it would be for most emergency situa-\\ntions!)  \\n \\nWe are capable of doing without a lot of things, even when we’re stressed. However, having famil-\\niar food to eat when everything else is going badly gives us comfort far beyond the cost of the \\nfood. Food is such an important part of creating and maintaining a positive attitude, especially \\n \\nPreparedness is \\nthe state of being \\nprepared or in put \\nin proper condition \\nof readiness before \\nan approaching \\nevent––something \\nexpected, even \\nthought possible, \\nor unexpected; to \\nput things or one-\\nself in readiness. \\n \\nWebster’s Dictionary \\nNotes \\n \\nNote the wide mar-\\ngins––make notes \\nand use the space \\nfor your questions, \\nideas, and plans to \\nmake certain your \\nfuture is as secure \\nas possible.  \\n \\n.',\n",
              " '72-Hr.+ Emergency/Preparedness Action Kit  \\uf0ae  \\n3 \\n \\n \\n \\nwhen all else is falling apart, that it bears repeating: don’t take anyone else’s opinion about your \\nemergency food supply––store what you like to eat and you’ll eat what you’ve stored––and you \\nwon’t lose it! \\n \\nWipes: intimated that if I ate during this camping trip, eventually the natural necessity for wipes \\nwould occur. Not to mention a runny nose from the overnight in the wilderness! Wipes were in-\\ndeed essential then for any trip away from home––and still are! This was also meant to remind me \\nabout the need for good personal hygiene and grooming––a little soap and elbow grease to remove \\nthe dirt and smoke odor from my body and clothing. There is no greater comfort than being our \\nbest self––putting our best foot forward––handling whatever we encounter with panache and style.  \\n \\nWarmth: how can anyone be prepared if the elements are ignored? Back then, the job of finding \\nboth small and effective means of keeping warm was more difficult. Today we have modern tech-\\nnology––so many new fabrics for clothing and camping gear, equipment, and supplies to help in \\nthis life-saving necessity. Of course, let us not forget the need for fire to prepare food, purify wa-\\nter, and provide warm water for bathing. \\n \\nWeather protection: this was the need for adequate shelter from the unpredictable spring weather \\nin North Carolina––a tent and some waterproof matches. For today’s considerations it includes the \\nprovision of living space that precludes a family from suffering the effects of inclement weather––\\nwhether it’s intemperate climate, moisture, or wind-driven forces. \\n \\nWeapon: a brand-new Swiss knife attached to my belt for all to see––talk about proud! Nobody \\nwas going to mess with me and the complete arsenal at my fingertips. I was prepared for even a \\nbear! Besides, it was a miracle-making tool just waiting to be unleashed, whether for opening a can \\nof weenies, beans or soup, shaving a stick for fire tender, or carving an ―X‖ on a tree to mark the \\ntrail (forgive me, tree-huggers––I was only 12 years old!) \\n \\nWayfinder: meant having the appropriate equipment, such as a wrist compass and a local area \\nroad map. At least, I could find my way back to the camp, home, or anywhere on that map, should \\nI be the victim of a ―snipe hunt‖ with the senior scouts. Make sure you have maps of local streets, \\nas well as maps of your destination, if you must depart from your home. \\n \\nWatchful eye: this part of the communication was a little bit trickier because it was somewhat \\nmore philosophic, but I know it meant being prepared for any emergency. I practiced until I was \\ncompass-trained and physically ready to take the fifty-mile hike. I was also required to learn all the \\nfirst aid information, up to and including how to cut the ―X‖ through the skin for subsequent \\nsnakebite treatment. Thank heaven that treatment has been superseded! Actually, upon reflection, I \\ncouldn’t have cut the snake, much less cut an ―X‖ on my own body! \\n \\nWhatever: meant a category was for anything I wanted to take that wasn’t in the proscribed cate-\\ngories listed above––like my genuine silver-plated Duncan yo-yo!…or the latest Marvel comic \\nbook… or jacks and marbles––whatever was important then for my comfort and pleasure under \\ntrying conditions!  \\n \\nWatchcare: meant caring about the others on the camping trip. This was a quality my mother had \\nin bountiful supply––she really cared about others, constantly on the lookout for someone who \\nneeded a lift. Her ―good neighbor‖ policy was in full force at all times. She practiced the true spirit \\nof caring about those in her community.  \\n \\nSo, my mother’s instructions sent me scurrying enthusiastically throughout all three floors of the \\nhouse, looking for the equipment I needed to impress the older Scouts in the troop. As the see-\\nmingly essential items were located, I placed all the pieces of equipment and little piles on my up-\\nper bunk, then called her for approval. At this point I learned how to choose what is essential, and \\nhow to focus on economy, efficiency, and personal well-being.  \\n \\nMother regarded all the gear and paraphernalia I had assembled. I remember her saying quietly, \\n“Pep without purpose is piffle!” She gently (well, not so gently that I soon forgot!) instructed me \\nto sort all of my stuff into three piles. I was to place in the first pile the items I couldn’t do without, \\na second pile for ―stuff‖ I thought I might need, and a third pile for the things I’d like to take with \\nme.  \\n \\nNotes \\n \\nPlanning will assure \\nyou’ve considered \\nyour needs in case of \\nan emergency, disas-\\nter, or life-threatening \\nsituations.',\n",
              " '4 \\n\\uf0aeYour Personal & Family E-PAK \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAfter I had ordered my piles as instructed, mother looked at the three piles carefully and made a \\ncouple of corrections to my piles. She then told me to return the stuff heaped in the second and \\nthird piles to the drawers and closets––and to place in the camp bag only the items in the first pile. \\nYou know, even years later, mother’s words were my guidance when I traveled more than a million \\nmiles as an international business traveler. What I eventually learned is that the quality of any trip \\nis being able to travel without a great deal of non-elemental ―stuff.‖ \\n \\nSURVIVAL OR PREPAREDNESS KITS? \\n \\nResponsibility for your family begins in your own home. You are ultimately responsible for pro-\\ntecting yourself, your family, and your property to the best of your capability. This entails planning \\nand preparing your own resources to mitigate the effects of by preparing for, responding to, and \\neventually, recovering from natural and people-caused disasters that often become our personal \\ndisasters. Being prepared requires learning about potential disasters and emergencies, knowing \\nfirst aid, CPR, and other life-saving skills.  \\n \\nAdaptability is critical to preparedness and self-reliance. A sense of independence is necessary, \\ntoo. Unfortunately, self-reliance skills are not taught in the schools––they are learned at the hand \\nof a tough and uncaring taskmaster! How well you respond to these disasters is determined by your \\nlevel of preparation.  \\n \\nThere are five basics you should stock in your home: (1) water, (2) food, (3) first aid supplies, in-\\ncluding medication(s), (4) clothing and bedding, and (5) tools, emergency supplies, and special \\nneeds items. Keep the items you will most likely need during an evacuation in an easy-to-carry \\ncontainer such as a large, covered trash container, camping bag, backpack, or duffel bag. Keep a \\nmini-version of the disaster supplies kit in the trunk of your car—and one for each vehicle your \\nfamily utilizes. \\n \\nUtilize all the knowledge you can gain to prepare for the disasters which could cause you and your \\nfamily more than loss of your car, your property, or your crops. To become truly prepared, you \\nmust re-forge yourself, break out of the mold, study, learn, practice, and increasingly improve your \\nself-reliance skills until you are comfortable with your new self. There is no easy way to become \\nself-reliant—it requires work! To become self-reliant requires also meaningful efforts in self-\\neducation and often, some large measures of self-denial.  \\n \\nIT’S YOUR CHOICE––MINIMAL …OR MORE? \\n \\nThere are different levels or factors of risk associated with the many different types of disasters. \\nThere are varying levels of preparation. So this is the best rule for becoming prepared: \\n \\nYour preparation level should always exceed the risk level!  \\n \\nGo back to Chart 1 – Potential Weather-Related Disasters by Listed to see the listing of the \\nexpected weather-related disasters that could affect your particular geographic location.  \\n \\nThere are three (3) types of actions from which you can choose to help you deal with these poten-\\ntially disastrous weather-related conditions should you be victimized by them.  \\n \\nYou alone make the choice from among these options: \\n1. Survival––requiring minimal investment or effort; survival mode places you in the con-\\ntrol of happenstance and volunteers––or not! \\n2. Preparedness (at some level)––all levels of preparedness require serious effort and sub-\\nstantial investment of your time, personal energy, and money; and, \\n3. Self-Reliance––preparing at the highest level of your family’s capability, learning, doing, \\nand adapting your lifestyle; sharing and being a resource to your community. \\n \\nSTATE NATURAL DISASTERS VULNERABILITY CHART \\n \\nCheck your Sate listing in the chart below to ascertain the Natural Disasters types to which you \\nmight be vulnerable.  \\n \\nFor additional local information, contact Homeland Security/FEMA, State Emergency, or County \\nDisasters Management offices. \\n \\n \\nNotes \\n \\nTake control of your \\nlife and you can turn \\nunfavorable situations \\ninto manageable \\nevents.',\n",

              " '6 \\n\\uf0aeYour Personal & Family E-PAK \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nDESIGNING YOUR EMERGENCY/PREPAREDNESS ACTION KIT \\n \\nOn the following pages are detailed listings to help you personalize your own 72-hour kit—the \\nEmergency/Preparedness Action Kit (E/PAK.) \\n \\nUse the charts to determine what you have in inventory already for your family E/PAK and to de-\\nfine the needs for each member of the family––items, quantities, and selections of foods, foods-\\ntuffs, and equipment. Keep items for a family evacuation in easy-to-carry containers. You decide \\nwhether a large, covered trash container, camping backpack, footlocker, plastic chest, or duffel bag \\nsuits your needs best. \\n \\nIf you have the resources, keep an E/PAK in the trunk of your car. You may want one at your place \\nof business, also. It’s cheap insurance for saving your life––or the life of a family member, a \\nfriend, or a co-worker! Hopefully, most of us won’t need the E/PAK, but being prepared for the \\neventuality is good to ease the mind. I hope the worst case for our individual E/PAK is to have in a \\ncentral location all the things we’d need for ―hunkering down‖ when a natural disaster, such as a \\nwind, ice, or snowstorm, or a people-caused disaster causes a power outage.  \\n \\n \\n―Bug-out‖ or Not? \\n \\nPersonally, I don’t plan to ―bug-out!‖ I don’t have any other place I want to go, unless it’s to an \\nexpensive hotel that has complete and luxurious facilities. With my 3-day kit in hand, I could even \\nendure a public shelter! I just don’t intend to leave my home and all the equipment unless a life-\\nthreatening disaster requires it. Having reviewed the potential natural, people-caused, and personal \\ndisasters that could possibly happen to me, the alternatives are clear to me as to what I would do in \\neach case. \\n \\nI’ve spent the weekend in a church recreation hall with several other families, during and in the \\naftermath of an ice storm. It wasn’t too bad––the worst part was the lack of privacy and no heat. \\nI’ve also spent a few days at my parents’ house––kids and all––when the side of town where we \\nlived had a power failure––and we had an all-electric home! I certainly don’t intend to head for the \\nunfamiliar hills, living in the wilderness fraught with unknown dangers, chasing wild animals with \\nswitches, fending off others in a similar plight, and trying to maintain an urban lifestyle.  \\n \\nHowever, the very thought of driving on the freeway or city streets during a disaster situation, \\ncompeting for space with all those folks carrying handguns (even the ones with permits) and other \\nweapons is just a little frightening to me. Whereas I can’t defend the entire city, I could maintain \\nmy independence in my own home with adequate provisions. \\n \\nMy plans are to enjoy the disaster and appreciate the intervention in my normally extra-long work-\\nday to spend it with my wife, my dogs, and the peace and quiet the lack of electricity would bring.  \\n \\nPerhaps it would be a moment to pretend it’s another vacation in the back hills of the Appala-\\nchians… \\n \\nChoose and act accordingly!  \\nCarpe diem because tempus fugit!',\n",

Every 90 to 180 days the E/PAK should \\nbe inventoried. Exchange water, food, and clothing for current supplies. Consume the goods to \\nassure yourself of your choices. Check to assure the E/PAK is re-provisioned with your new inven-\\ntory, and re-set in its storage location.  \\n \\nEnjoy this requirement for rotation. Buy some really good gourmet-type foods for your E/PAK \\n(you’d certainly eat the gourmet- and picnic-quality foodstuffs you’d find at a high-class business \\nparty, classy brunch, or invitation-only social event) and have an ―emergency picnic‖ with your \\nrotated foods. These emergency preparedness ―trial runs‖ will provide occasional practice for the \\ntime(s) when disasters for which you’ve prepared actually occur. It’ll further prepare you mentally \\nfor the eventuality of a disaster, and make the event’s foreboding nature a little more bearable. \\n \\n \\nE/PAK Categories \\n \\nSupply categories are as follows, with the correlation of E/PAK categories to my Mother’s list:  \\n \\nE/PAK Categories \\nMother’s Categories \\n1.

              " '12 \\n\\uf0aeYour Personal & Family E-PAK \\n \\n \\n \\nWHY ONLY 72-HOUR EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS? \\n \\nThere is no intent in this document to discuss all the causes and solutions for emergencies and dis-\\nasters. There are, however, numerous resources which can help you prepare for natural or people-\\ncaused disasters, or for any resultant personal disasters that might occur to you and your family. \\nThere is an additional listing of resources on the back page.  \\nFor all the minute details of 72-hour (or longer) emergency preparedness issues, there are a few \\nbooks I suggest you read and utilize. One of the best overall books is Barbara Salisbury’s, \\n―PLAN ...NOT PANIC, 72-Hour Survival/Emergency Evacuation.”1 She also has a newer book, \\nPreparedness Principles, with some additional excellent ideas. Preparedness Principles is a big, \\ncomprehensive volume of work about preparedness.  \\nBarbara––whom I’ve known since 1972 and respected some time before then––defines an evacua-\\ntion as a localized occurrence which forces residents from their homes on a moment’s notice. It \\nonly takes being forced from your home one time to convince the wise person of the need for an \\nemergency kit that is prepared in advance and available for use when needed. In her book, origi-\\nnally published in May 1994, she provides step-by-step instructions––missing from most other \\nemergency/disasters publications––for the preparation of a personalized 72-hour kit. As I read her \\nbook cover to cover, I’ll remark on some things she points out that are critical for each of us to \\nknow: \\n\\uf071 \\nIt\\'s a fact of life that sooner or later you may have to be evacuated from your home!  \\n\\uf071 \\nPanic takes over if practical preparation has been ignored. \\n\\uf071 \\nLag-Time\\uf032––not the disaster––is the reason for a 72-hour kit! This is probably the least \\nunderstood point in this facet of emergency preparedness.  \\n\\uf071 \\nLag-Time is the villain of most evacuations. It is imperative to understand its impact on \\nall facets of preparation for an evacuation.  \\n\\uf071 \\nThe more severe the disaster, the greater the corresponding impact of Lag-Time.  \\n\\uf071 \\nLag-Time is why you can\\'t rely on the government or emergency disaster organizations to \\ncome to your aid immediately.  \\n\\uf071 \\nWhen individuals are prepared to take care of themselves, they have greater security. \\n\\uf071 \\nProperly prepared persons are a tremendous help for those who eventually arrive to assist \\nand support in disaster situations. \\nAccording to Barbara, the critical parameters of a well-planned and well thought-out 72-hour \\nevacuation and survival plan are: \\n\\uf071 \\nUnderstanding the two categories of emergency preparedness and how it affects not \\nonly your preparation, but also your ultimate survival. \\n\\uf071 \\nUsing a Neighborhood Evaluation Form to determine if there is a potential evacuation \\nlurking in your future. \\n\\uf071 \\nCreating a 72-hour kit economically to meet your personal needs. \\n\\uf071 \\nIncluding more than three “energy bars” and a flashlight in your 72-hour kit! \\n\\uf071 \\nKnowing why the right kinds of foods are vital in an emergency situation––and are \\nvery different from those typically kept on the emergency shelf. \\n\\uf071 \\nHaving an emergency water supply is essential. \\n\\uf071 \\nDesigning your own „\\'security blanket.‟‟ \\n                                                 \\n1 Barbara Salsbury is a nationally recognized consumer specialist, author, and lecturer. Among the many cre-\\ndits of this author is her book Plan...Not Panic––The 72 Hour Survival/Emergency Evacuation Manual. \\nThe information in her latest book has been the basis for workshops and seminars presented throughout the \\nnation to groups including The American Red Cross, University Special Courses, corporate \"Brown Bag\" \\nlunch workshops, Adult Continuing Education Programs, civic groups, clubs, churches, service, and profes-\\nsional groups. As a frequent guest on the radio and television talk show circuit, she has appeared on the Phil \\nDonahue Show, Gary Collins’ Hour Magazine, Sally Jesse Raphael’s Talk Show, as a regular with Vicki Law-\\nrence, and as Consumer Specialist on the Great American Homemaker. \\n    Go to Barbara’s website: http://solutionsforpreparedness.com/preprinc for more information about all her \\nbooks and resources. \\n \\n \\nNotes',\n",

              " '72-Hr.+ Emergency/Preparedness Action Kit  \\uf0ae  \\n13 \\n \\n \\n \\n\\uf071 \\nEstablishing a \"Care-In-A-Crisis\" plan is critical to all of your family members. \\n\\uf071 \\nKnowing what you must do about shelter, heat, and warmth. \\n\\uf071 \\nDon\\'t ignore the need for personal sanitation! \\n\\uf071 \\nPreparing properly with the exclusive Personal Planning Pages can make the differ-\\nence between panic and the ability to cope with an emergency situation. \\nOften in the aftermath of natural or people-caused disasters, everyone taught that as much as 3 \\ndays (72 hours) lapses between the actual occurrence of the emergency and the arrival or availabil-\\nity of competent help. After the experiences of Hurricane Katrina and other cataclysms such as \\nthe Indonesian tsunami, we no longer adhere to that expectation. Depending on the gross amount \\nof damages, the extent of the disaster’s footprint, and it geographic location, the response time for \\nrelief care of is extended to as much as 7-10 days before aid is organized and operating effectively.  \\n \\nThere are two other friends who are authors and specialist with solid information and expertise on \\nthe subject of preparedness. One of them is Rita Bingham, a preparedness issues author and natu-\\nral meals specialist. Preview her preparedness book, The New Passport To Survival––12 Steps to \\nSelf-Sufficient Living. Rita is also a long-time acquaintance, and her specialty lies in her know-\\nledge of nutrition and natural foods. Her books are available on her website:  \\nhttp://www.naturalmeals.com/passportnew.html. \\n \\nAnother friend and expert is LeArta Moulton, author, and food storage specialist. LeArta has 30 \\nyears of extensive research on using whole foods, herbs, home remedies, and survival techniques. \\nGo to her website to download natural and herbal information:  \\nhttp://www.livingwithbasics.com/foodstorage.html \\n \\nYou alone may be responsible for the provision of adequate food, water, shelter, etc., for your very \\nsurvival during the period of time it takes for the arrival of the emergency and disaster relief organ-\\nizations! \\n \\nE/PAK –– SOME ESSENTIAL GUIDELINES \\nTo provide you and your family maximum protection in case of an emergency, your E/PAK––\\nwhether for 72 hours or for several weeks––should meet these minimum requirements: \\uf0b7\\n \\nAccessibility –– Keep your kit in sight near a strong exit doorway, where you can grab it \\non the way out. Don\\'t hide your kit or place it where it might get covered. \\uf0b7\\n \\nCompleteness –– Check your kit regularly to assure yourself everything your family \\nneeds for three days\\' survival––or longer––is in the kit and ready for use. \\uf0b7\\n \\nIndividuality –– Everyone in the family must have a backpack or portable system!  You \\nmay not be together from the outset, or you could become separated by events. \\uf0b7\\n \\nPersonalization –– Use the lists in this book to check and re-check what you may need. \\nCommercial and generic kits––even long supply lists––can’t presume to provide com-\\npletely for the unique needs of you and your family. Any kit you fail to design for your \\npersonal needs will just be someone else’s opinion of your needs. With experience, you \\nwill learn to make content adjustments to meet your changing needs.  \\uf0b7\\n \\nPortability –– Keep all kits light enough it can be carried without undue strain on your \\nbody––it   may be useless if it can’t be carried by it intended user. Keep all kits tightly \\npacked and as light as possible. \\uf0b7\\n \\nRotation  –– Rotate food, water, batteries, and medications frequently, at least every 3 to \\n6 months, to keep all use by dates current. More frequent rotation for items stored in tem-\\nperatures exceeding 70oF would be prudent. Check all clothing articles frequently to as-\\nsure continuing fit.  \\uf0b7\\n \\nUtilization –– Make sure you can operate or effectively use all items in your E/PAK. Al-\\nways buy the best quality you can afford––your life could depend on what you have in \\nyour kit! Don\\'t weigh down your kit with stuff! \\uf0b7\\n \\nVersatility ––Assure your kit contains supplies for an emergency staycation as well as \\nfor evacuation. You might not be able to evacuate. \\nNotes',\n",

              " '14 \\n\\uf0aeYour Personal & Family E-PAK \\n \\n \\n \\n \\uf0b7\\n \\nWaterproof –– Place all items inside individual freezer-quality Ziploc® or similar water-\\nproof plastic bags. Protect all contents from water––whether humidity or floodwaters! \\nTO LEAVE?… OR NOT TO LEAVE?… THAT IS THE QUESTION! \\n \\nHopefully, most of you won’t ever need your E/PAK. However, being prepared for such an even-\\ntuality is good to ease the mind. My personal desire is that I’ll never need my E/PAK for any \\nemergency. Yet, it will always be in a special location in my home near a protected exit, filled with \\nall the things I’d need for ―hunkering down‖ when a natural disaster, such as a wind, ice, or snows-\\ntorm, or a people-caused disaster causes a power outage.  \\n \\nLots of people tell me they plan to ―bug out.‖ Personally, I plan to stay at home unless a life-\\nthreatening disaster requires my departure. There is no place I want to go––except maybe to an \\nexpensive hotel. However, with my personal 72-hour kit, I could even endure a public shelter, if \\nnecessary. I’ve spent a weekend in a church recreation hall during an ice storm with several other \\nfamilies––it wasn’t too bad, except for the lack of privacy. I’ve also spent a few days at my par-\\nents’ home during several power outages––with all the kids, grandkids, and their collective dogs.  \\n \\nBut heading for the unfamiliar hills, living in the wilderness fraught with unknown dangers, chas-\\ning wild animals with switches, fending off others in a similar plight to mine––all the while trying \\nto maintain an urban lifestyle does not seem a good option to me. The very thought of getting on \\nthe freeway or city streets during or following a disaster, competing for space with all those folks \\ncarrying handguns (even if they do have permits) and other nefarious weapons, is just a little frigh-\\ntening. On the streets I know I cannot defend myself adequately. At home, I can maintain my inde-\\npendence as long as I have my personal provisions to sustain me until the crisis period is past. \\n \\nMy personal plans in the case of a local disaster––such as an electrical failure––are to make the \\nbest of a bad situation, enjoy the intervention in my normally extra-long, tiring workday, and spend \\nit with my wife (and the dog) in the ensuing peace and quiet––hoping the electricity will return––\\nbut not too soon!. It would be a moment to take a long nap, pull out the IPod, pop the top of a can \\nof sardines, get out the comfort foods and enjoy a belated vacation––savoring the quiet, and listen-\\ning to all those short-wave radio programs I’ve been wanting to listen to for ages… \\n \\nBUT, IF YOU MUST LEAVE... \\n \\nHowever, if you must leave home unexpectedly (perhaps like those in California who had to eva-\\ncuate due to wildfires), be sure to have the following information ready to go with you: \\n \\n\\uf071 \\ndaily contact details for family members  \\n\\uf071 \\nlocal reunion points \\n\\uf071 \\nout of area contacts \\n\\uf071 \\npertinent family operating data \\n \\nChart 3 (following section) is a series of charts for accumulating critical post-emergency and dis-\\naster information. Completing the charts provides you the opportunity to record what everyone in \\nthe family––and perhaps, emergency personnel––would need concerning the daily whereabouts of \\neach family member and how they can be contacted.  \\n \\nIt might be appropriate to keep the less confidential information on the family bulletin board (in \\nour house it’s the refrigerator door!), a copy in each E/PAK, and a copy in your wallet. It would be \\nwise to send a copy to a trusted friend or relative, your attorney, CPA, or parents. Remember to \\nupdate this information with all members of the family or group as contact numbers and locations \\nchange.  \\n \\nKeep in mind that during times of natural or people-caused disasters, local telephone service is \\noften disrupted. Therefore, each member of the household should have a cell phone, with the \\nname, phone number, and address of a person designated as an out-of-area contact. (Note: long \\ndistance lines and cell phones may remain active during emergencies. These services will normally  \\nbe restored before residential lines. If separated, each family member should call the designated \\nout-of-area contact and communicate his particular situation within a certain period of time, report-\\ning his physical condition, his location, and other information as previously agreed upon. Keep \\nadequate change in your E/PAK for making pay phone calls––if you can still find one! Small \\nchange will buy small items––if they are available.  \\nNotes \\n \\nYour best family \\nemergency network is \\nthe cell phone!',\n",

              " \"Fire Safety and Extinguishers \\nTypes of Extinguishers \\nWith so many fire extinguishers to choose from, selecting the proper one for your home can be a daunting \\ntask. Everyone should have at least one fire extinguisher at home, but it's just as important to ensure you \\nhave the proper type of fire extinguisher. Fire protection experts recommend one for the kitchen, the garage \\nand workshop. \\nFire extinguishers are divided into four categories, based on different types of fires. Each fire extinguisher \\nalso has a numerical rating that serves as a guide for the amount of fire the extinguisher can handle. The \\nhigher the number, the more fire-fighting power. The following is a quick guide to help choose the right type of \\nextinguisher.  \\n \\n• \\nClass A extinguishers are for ordinary combustible materials such as \\npaper, wood, cardboard, and most plastics. The numerical rating on these \\ntypes of extinguishers indicates the amount of water it holds and the \\namount of fire it can extinguish.  \\n• \\nClass B fires involve flammable or combustible liquids such as gasoline, \\nkerosene, grease and oil. The numerical rating for class B extinguishers \\nindicates the approximate number of square feet of fire it can extinguish.  \\n• \\nClass C fires involve electrical equipment, such as appliances, wiring, \\ncircuit breakers and outlets. Never use water to extinguish class C fires - \\nthe risk of electrical shock is far too great! Class C extinguishers do not \\nhave a numerical rating. The C classification means the extinguishing \\nagent is non-conductive. \\n• \\nClass D fire extinguishers are commonly found in a chemical laboratory. \\nThey are for fires that involve combustible metals, such as magnesium, \\ntitanium, potassium and sodium. These types of extinguishers also have no \\nnumerical rating, nor are they given a multi-purpose rating - they are \\ndesigned for class D fires only. \\nSome fires may involve a combination of these classifications. Your fire extinguishers should have ABC \\nratings on them.  \\nHere are the most common types of fire extinguishers: \\n• \\nWater extinguishers or APW extinguishers (air-pressurized water) are suitable for class A fires \\nonly. Never use a water extinguisher on grease fires, electrical fires or class D fires - the flames will \\nspread and make the fire bigger! Water extinguishers are filled with water and pressurized with \\noxygen. Again - water extinguishers can be very dangerous in the wrong type of situation. Only fight \\nthe fire if you're certain it contains ordinary combustible materials only. \\n• \\nDry chemical extinguishers come in a variety of types and are suitable for a combination of class A, \\nB and C fires. These are filled with foam or powder and pressurized with nitrogen.  \\no BC - This is the regular type of dry chemical extinguisher. It is filled with sodium bicarbonate \\nor potassium bicarbonate. The BC variety leaves a mildly corrosive residue which must be \\ncleaned immediately to prevent any damage to materials.  \\no ABC - This is the multipurpose dry chemical extinguisher. The ABC type is filled with \\nmonoammonium phosphate, a yellow powder that leaves a sticky residue that may be \\ndamaging to electrical appliances such as a computer \\nDry chemical extinguishers have an advantage over CO2 extinguishers since they leave a non-flammable \\nsubstance on the extinguished material, reducing the likelihood of re-ignition.\",\n",
              " '',\n",
              " \"• \\nCarbon Dioxide (CO2) extinguishers are used for class B and C fires. CO2 extinguishers contain \\ncarbon dioxide, a non-flammable gas, and are highly pressurized. The pressure is so great that it is \\nnot uncommon for bits of dry ice to shoot out the nozzle. They don't work very well on class A fires \\nbecause they may not be able to displace enough oxygen to put the fire out, causing it to re-ignite.  \\nCO2 extinguishers have an advantage over dry chemical extinguishers since they don't leave a harmful \\nresidue - a good choice for an electrical fire on a computer or other favorite electronic device such as a stereo \\nor TV. \\n \\nIt is vital to know what type of extinguisher you are using. Using the wrong type of extinguisher for \\nthe wrong type of fire can be life-threatening. \\n \\nThese are only the common types of fire extinguishers. There are many others to choose from. Base your \\nselection on the classification and the extinguisher's compatibility with the items you wish to protect.  \\nFire needs fuel, oxygen and heat in order to burn. In simple terms, fire extinguishers remove one of these \\nelements by applying an agent that either cools the burning fuel, or removes or displaces the surrounding \\noxygen. \\nFire extinguishers are filled with water or a smothering material, such as CO2. By pulling out the safety pin \\nand depressing the lever at the top of the cylinder (the body of the extinguisher), this material is released by \\nhigh amounts of pressure.  \\nHow it Works \\nAt the top of the cylinder, there is a smaller cylinder filled with compressed gas. A release valve acts as a \\nlocking mechanism and prevents this gas from escaping. When you pull the safety pin and squeeze the lever, \\nthe lever pushes on an actuating rod which presses the valve down to open a passage to the nozzle. The \\ncompressed gas is released, applying a downward pressure on the fire-extinguishing material. This pushes \\nthe material out the nozzle with high amounts of pressure.  \\nAlthough the temptation is to aim the extinguisher at the flames, the proper way to use the extinguisher is to \\naim it directly at the fuel. \\nWater Extinguishers \\nWater extinguishers are filled with regular tap water and pressurized with oxygen. The best way to remove \\nheat is to dump water on the fire but, depending on the type of fire, this is not always the best option.  \\nDry Chemical Extinguishers \\nDry chemical extinguishers are filled with either foam or powder, usually sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) or \\npotassium bicarbonate, and pressurized with nitrogen. Baking soda is effective because it decomposes at 158 \\ndegrees Fahrenheit and releases carbon dioxide (which smothers oxygen) once it decomposes. Dry chemical \\nextinguishers interrupt the chemical reaction of the fire by coating the fuel with a thin layer of powder or foam, \\nseparating the fuel from the surrounding oxygen.  \\nCarbon Dioxide (CO2) extinguishers \\nCO2 extinguishers contain carbon dioxide, a non-flammable gas, and are highly pressurized. The pressure is \\nso great that it is not uncommon for bits of dry ice to shoot out. CO2 is heavier than oxygen so these \\nextinguishers work by displacing or taking away oxygen from the surrounding area. CO2 is also very cold so it \\nalso works by cooling the fuel.\",\n",
              " \"Using Extinguishers \\nBefore using your fire extinguisher, be sure to read the instructions before it's too late. Although there are \\nmany different types of fire extinguishers, all of them operate in a similar manner.  \\nUse this acronym as a quick reference (it is a good idea to print this reference and pin it next to your fire \\nextinguisher): \\nP \\nA \\nS \\nS \\nPull the Pin at the top of the extinguisher. The pin releases a locking mechanism and will allow you to \\ndischarge the extinguisher.  \\nAim at the base of the fire, not the flames. This is important - in order to put out the fire, you must \\nextinguish the fuel.  \\nSqueeze the lever slowly. This will release the extinguishing agent in the extinguisher. If the handle is \\nreleased, the discharge will stop.  \\nSweep from side to side. Using a sweeping motion, move the fire extinguisher back and forth until the fire is \\ncompletely out. Operate the extinguisher from a safe distance, several feet away, and then move towards the \\nfire once it starts to diminish. Be sure to read the instructions on your fire extinguisher - different fire \\nextinguishers recommend operating them from different distances. Remember: Aim at the base of the fire, not \\nat the flames!!!! \\n \\nA typical fire extinguisher contains 10 seconds of extinguishing power. This could be less if it has already \\nbeen partially discharged. Always read the instructions that come with the fire extinguisher beforehand and \\nbecome familiarized with its parts. It is highly recommended by fire prevention experts that you get hands-on \\ntraining before operating a fire extinguisher. Most local fire departments offer this service.  \\nOnce the fire is out, don't walk away! Watch the area for a few minutes in case it re-ignites. Recharge the \\nextinguisher immediately after use.  \\nMaintaining Extinguishers \\nInspect fire extinguishers at least once a month (more often in severe environments). \\nFire extinguisher maintenance is important for everyone’s safety.  \\nIf the extinguisher is damaged or needs recharging, replace it immediately! \\nYou must ensure that: \\n• \\nThe extinguisher is not blocked by equipment, coats or other objects that could interfere with access \\nin an emergency. \\n• \\nThe pressure is at the recommended level. On extinguishers equipped with a gauge (such as that \\nshown on the right), the needle should be in the green zone - not too high and not too low. \\n• \\nThe nozzle or other parts are not hindered in any way. \\n• \\nThe pin and tamper seal (if it has one) are intact. \\n• \\nThere are no dents, leaks, rust, chemical deposits and/or other signs of abuse/wear. Wipe off any \\ncorrosive chemicals, oil, gunk etc. that may have deposited on the extinguisher. \\nSome manufacturers recommend shaking your dry chemical extinguishers once a month to prevent the \\npowder from settling/packing.  \\nFire extinguishers should be pressure tested (a process called hydrostatic testing) after a number of years to \\nensure that the cylinder is safe to use. Consult your owner's manual, extinguisher label or the manufacturer to \\nsee when yours may need such testing.\",\n",
              " \"IMPORTANT: Recharge all extinguishers immediately after use regardless of how much they were \\nused. \\n \\nAn inspection is a “quick check” to give reasonable assurance that a fire extinguisher is available, fully \\ncharged and operable. The value of an inspection lies in the frequency, regularity, and thoroughness with \\nwhich it is conducted. The frequency will vary from hourly to monthly, based on the needs of the situation. \\nInspections should always be conducted when extinguishers are initially placed in service and thereafter at \\napproximately 30-day intervals.  \\n \\nMAINTENANCE  \\nFire extinguishers should be maintained at regular intervals (at least once a year), or when specifically \\nindicated by an inspection. Maintenance is a “thorough check” of the extinguisher. It is intended to give \\nmaximum assurance that an extinguisher will operate effectively and safely. It includes a thorough \\nexamination and any necessary repair, recharging or replacement. It will normally reveal the need for \\nhydrostatic testing of an extinguisher. \\nLocation of Extinguishers \\nHaving a fire extinguisher is one thing, having it handy in case of an emergency, is another.  \\nIt is recommended to have at least one fire extinguisher on each floor of your home. Also, keep them in plain \\nsight and no more than five feet above the floor. Do not put them in closets because that will cost you \\nvaluable time when you are reaching for it. And even though a fire extinguisher may not match your décor, do \\nnot put it behind curtains or drapes.  \\nThe most important places to have a fire extinguisher are in areas that are more susceptible to fire. These \\nareas are the kitchen and the garage.  \\nKitchen: According to U.S. Fire Administration statistics, the kitchen is the place where fires most often start. \\nIf you have a fire extinguisher in the kitchen, most grease fires can be contained. Do not put the fire \\nextinguisher near the stove as it will be out of your reach if the fire is on the stovetop. You should not have to \\nrisk burns just to reach your extinguisher. Therefore, the best place to put the fire extinguisher is by the door \\nof the kitchen so you have easy access to it.  \\nGarage: It is a good idea to keep a fire extinguisher here because in most homes, this is the place we use as \\nstorage. Often, leftover paints, solvents, and building materials will be piled up without a second thought. \\nAgain, the best location to mount the fire extinguisher is by the door.  \\nFire Prevention \\nThe National Fire Protection Association reports 85% of fire deaths occur in the home, making fire prevention \\na top priority in every home. Here is a list of some of the less obvious tips for fire prevention, based on the \\nmost common causes of fires:  \\nCooking equipment  \\n• \\nKeep appliances clean, and wipe surfaces after spills. Clean stove surfaces and ovens regularly.  \\n• \\nWear tight-fitting sleeves, or roll them up when cooking  \\n• \\nKeep flammable objects, including pot holders, dish towels and curtains, at least three feet away from \\nthe stove.  \\n• \\nWood and coal stoves, fireplaces, chimneys, and all other solid-fueled heating equipment needs to be \\ninspected annually by a professional and cleaned accordingly.  \\n• \\nAssure microwaves have enough room to breathe, that all the vents are cleared of obstructions. \\n• \\nIf there is a microwave fire, keep the door closed and unplug the microwave. Make sure to have the \\nmicrowave oven serviced before you use it again.  \\n• \\nIf there is an oven fire, keep the door closed and turn off the heat. If the fire doesn't go out \\nimmediately, call the fire department.\",\n",
              " '• \\nA grease fire occurs when oil or greasy foods are heated and ignite. The simplest way to fight a \\ngrease fire is to carefully slide a lid over the pan. Turn off the burner, don\\'t move the pan, and keep \\nthe lid on until the pan cools completely. Baking Soda may also be used to suffocate the fire. \\nNEVER PUT WATER ON A GREASE FIRE. Water causes the grease to splatter and the fire to \\nspread. Also, NEVER attempt to take a grease fire outdoors. It will be too hot to carry and you will \\ndrop it, causing a major house fire.  \\nHeating Equipment  \\n \\n• \\nHeating equipment is the leading cause of home fires during the winter months of December, January \\nand February, and is the second leading cause of home fires year round. \\n• \\nWhen buying heaters, look for devices with automatic shutoff features.  \\n• \\nBe sure any gas-fueled heating device is installed with proper attention to ventilation, and never put \\nun-vented gas space heaters in bedrooms or bathrooms. Liquefied Petroleum (LP) gas heaters with \\nself-contained fuel supplies are prohibited for home use by NFPA codes.  \\n• \\nNever leave space heaters on when you leave the room.  \\n• \\nSpace heaters should be kept at least three feet away from anything that can burn. \\n• \\nDon\\'t use extension cords with space heaters. The high amount of current they require could melt the \\ncord and start a fire.  \\n• \\nWhen lighting a gas space heater, strike your match first, then turn on the gas.  \\n• \\nNever use a gas range as a substitute for a furnace or space heater.  \\n \\n \\n \\nElectrical Distribution Equipment  \\n• \\nWiring, outlets, switches, circuit breakers and other electrical devices are the third leading cause of \\nhome fires and the second leading cause of fire deaths.  \\n• \\nReplace or repair loose or frayed cords on all electrical devices.  \\n• \\nIf outlets or switches feel warm, shut off the circuit and have them checked by an electrician.  \\n• \\nTry to avoid extension cords. If you feel an extension cord is necessary, make sure that it is not \\nfrayed or worn. Do not run it under carpet or around doorways. \\n• \\nNever overload a socket. The use of \"octopus\" outlets or \"power bar\", outlet extensions that \\naccommodate several plugs, is strongly discouraged. Try to limit one high-wattage appliance into \\neach individual outlet at a time. \\n• \\nIf a circuit breaker trips or a fuse blows frequently, cut down on the number of appliances on that line. \\nIn many older homes, the capacity of the wiring system has not kept pace with today\\'s modern \\nappliances and can overload electrical systems. Some overload signals include: dimming lights when \\nan appliance goes on, fuses blowing frequently or shrinking TV picture.  \\n• \\nAssure there\\'s plenty of air space around home entertainment units such as the TV and stereo to \\navoid overheating.  \\nAlthough some fires are caused by electrical system failures and appliance defects, many are caused by the \\nmisuse and poor maintenance of electrical appliances, incorrectly installed wiring, and overloaded circuits and \\nextension cords.  \\n \\nOther Sources  \\n \\n• \\nNever smoke in bed. Always look under cushions and in trashcans for burning cigarettes before going \\nto bed. Check carpeting where ashtrays have been used. \\n• \\nGet rid of stored newspaper or other unnecessary materials. Newspapers stored in a damp, warm \\nplace may ignite spontaneously.  \\n• \\nInstall smoke detectors on every level of your home and outside of sleeping areas.  \\n• \\nMount a fire extinguisher in the kitchen, garage and workshop.  \\n• \\nAgree in advance on an escape plan. There should be at least two exits in every room. \\n \\nNote: Half of all home fire deaths occur at night, so fire hazard checks and special attention to fire prevention \\nshould occur before going to bed.',\n",
              " 'Fighting a Fire \\nAll fires can be very dangerous and life-threatening. Your safety should always be your primary concern when \\nattempting to fight a fire.  \\nBefore deciding to fight a fire, be certain that:  \\n• \\nThe fire is small and not spreading. A fire can double in size within two or three minutes.  \\n• \\nYou have the proper fire extinguisher for what is burning.  \\n• \\nThe fire won\\'t block your exit if you can\\'t control it.

There\\'s not enough time to read instructions when a fire \\noccurs.  \\nHow to Fight a Fire Safely:  \\n \\n• \\nAlways stand with an exit at your back.  \\n• \\nStand several feet away from the fire, moving closer once the fire starts to diminish.  \\n• \\nUse a sweeping motion and aim at the base of the fire.  \\n• \\nIf possible, use a \"buddy system\" to have someone back you up or call for help if something goes \\nwrong.  \\n• \\nBe sure to watch the area for awhile to ensure it doesn\\'t re-ignite.  \\n \\nNever Fight A Fire If:  \\n• \\nThe fire is spreading rapidly. Only use a fire extinguisher when the fire is in its early stages. If the \\nfire is already spreading quickly, evacuate and call the fire department.  \\n• \\nYou don\\'t know what is burning. Unless you know what is burning, you won\\'t know what type of fire \\nextinguisher to use. Even if you have an ABC extinguisher, there could be something that will explode \\nor produce highly toxic smoke.  \\n• \\nYou don\\'t have the proper fire extinguisher. The wrong type of extinguisher can be dangerous or \\nlife-threatening. \\n• \\nThere is too much smoke or you are at risk of inhaling smoke. Seven out of ten fire-related \\ndeaths occur from breathing poisonous gases produced by the fire. \\nAny sort of fire will produce some amount of carbon monoxide, the most deadly gas produced by a fire. \\nMaterials such as wool, silk, nylon and some plastics can produce other highly toxic gases such as carbon \\ndioxide, hydrogen cyanide, or hydrogen chloride. Beware - all of these can be fatal.  \\nSmoke inhalation or exposure to fire itself can be life threatening so get educated about the basics in CPR \\nand burn treatment.',\n",

It may be necessary to plug some outlets \\nbelow the level of the weeping tile drains, in the primary sewer trap. Effective plugs \\ncan be made from wood or plastic bags. All plugs must be held in place by sandbags \\nor other heavy materials, or held in place by braces securely fastened to floor joists. \\n√ \\nMove all possessions within the structure above the projected flood water level \\n√ \\nPrepare sandbag-wall around your property (see sandbag dykes) \\n√ \\nRemove lawn furniture \\n√ \\nMove smaller outhouses to higher ground and away from potentially eroding \\nriverbanks.  \\n \\nSANDBAG DYKES  \\n \\nConstruction of a sandbag dyke requires special procedures to achieve maximum strength \\nand effectiveness. Should you choose to construct a sandbag dyke to protect your property in \\nthe event of a flood, the following tips may be useful.  \\n \\n1. Strip the sod or ground cover beneath the area for the proposed dyke and dig a \"bonding \\ntrench\" one sack in depth and two sacks wide as a foundation for the dyke structure.  \\n \\n2. To effectively provide protection from the forces of flooding water a dyke must be three \\ntimes as wide at its base as it is high. A dyke intended to be one metre high must have a \\nthree metre wide base.  \\n \\n3. Sandbags should never be filled more than half-full and must be laid in alternating \\ncrisscross directions. The base level should be laid parallel to the flow of the water, the \\nsecond level should be laid perpendicular to the flow, with the third level again laid parallel, \\ncontinuing to the intended height of the dyke. Each successive layer is set back one-half \\nsandbag width on both sides in each additional layer. A side view of a completed dyke would \\nshow a triangular cross section.  \\n \\n4. Individual bags need not be tied shut. Overlapping by successive bags will hold the sand in \\nplace. The method of keeping bag contents in place is called \"lapping.\"',\n",

Keep it in a handy place so that you and your family can refer to it quickly should any emergency threaten. Keep other emergency advice such as first aid and artificial respiration instructions, antidotes for poison, emergency telephone numbers, in the same place. Introduction The Canadian Government has joined other peace-minded nations in doing everything possible to reduce world tensions, to assist in the settlement of international disputes by peaceful means and to achieve disarmament with such controls as are necessary to preserve the security of all nations. However, the awesome threat of a major nuclear war involving North America remains a factor in plans for the defence of Canada. The nature and scale of a possible nuclear attack on North America, and the extent to which Canada would be involved in such an attack, cannot be predicted with accuracy. Our major centres would be at some risk of deliberate attack, random explosions could occur, and there would be the certainty of the danger from widespread, radioactive fallout over most of the Country. Governments at all levels have made, and are continuing to make, preparations which will reduce the number of casualties, safeguard survivors and contribute to the capacity of this nation to survive and recover from such a tragedy. The purpose of this booklet is to assist individuals and families in making personal survival plans and preparations to guard themselves against the potential dangers of nuclear war. Many of the precautions which are recommended will serve a double purpose in that they will save lives in peacetime disasters such as flood, tornado, fire, hurricane, blizzard, ice storm or earthquake. Attention has been directed to this important feature throughout the various steps. All Canadians are urged to read \"11 Steps to Survival\" with care to act on the advice it contains and to keep it handy for emergencies. Although protected by Crown Copyright, the contents may be reproduced in whole or in part provided proper acknowledgment of the source is made. The Queen\\'s Printer Ottawa, 1969 Cat. No. Id 83-1/4 The Eleven Steps to Survival Governments and communities at all levels are planning for the survival of our Nation in the event of a nuclear war. But the survival of individuals also will depend upon the preparation that each person makes. Persons ready to take the right action before and following an attack will increase their chances of survival. This pamphlet describes what YOU can do before and following a nuclear attack. You can greatly increase your family\\'s and your own protection by taking the Eleven Steps to Survival: l Step 1: Know the effects of nuclear explosions. l Step 2: Know the facts about radioactive fallout. l Step 3: Know the warning signal and have a battery-powered radio. l Step 4: Know how to take shelter. l Step 5: Have fourteen days emergency supplies. l Step 6: Know how to prevent and fight fires. l Step 7: Know first aid and home nursing. l Step 8: Know emergency cleanliness. l Step 9: Know how to get rid of radioactive dust. l Step 10: Know your municipal plans. l Step 11: Have a plan for your family and yourself. Step 1: Know the Effects of Nuclear Explosions A nuclear explosion releases vast amounts of energy in three forms: 1. Light and heat 2. Blast 3. Radiation The amount of energy released depends upon the size and design of the weapon. A wide range of weapons and delivery systems are available to an aggressor and we have no way of knowing what size of explosions might take place in Canada. For illustration purposes, we describe in this pamphlet the effects of a 5-megaton H-bomb equal to the explosive force of five million tons of TNT. Such a bomb could substantially damage the largest Canadian city. The effects depend upon whether the weapon is exploded high in the air, or on, or near the ground. An air burst usually produces more fire and blast-damage than a ground burst which results in a big crater and more radioactive fallout. The effects described below are approximate for a 5-megaton explosion and can only be approximate since effects depend upon a number of conditions such as weather, terrain, etc. mm Bns21 cHDAMN BNL yystaH mace uncrers HY Light and Heat A blaze of light brighter than the sun is produced by a nuclear explosion. It lasts for about 15 seconds. Temporary blindness and eye injury can result from the glare if eyes are not shielded. The heat rays from the explosion travel at the speed of light or about 186,000 miles per second. It can start fires up to 20 miles away. Many fires are caused when the heat pulse comes through a window to set fire to curtains, paper, clothing and furniture. The heat flash also can set fire to the outside of wooden buildings. The following are some examples of the predictable effects on unprotected skin of the heat flash of a 5-megaton weapon exploded on a clear day: l Skin is badly burned up to 15 miles from the explosion. l Skin is blistered up to 18 miles from the explosion. l Sunburn types of burns up to 23 miles from the explosion. Nuclear explosions in the air rather than on the ground are more likely to produce a greater number of serious burns through the heat flash. Clothing will give some protection. A shield between you and the light will give protection against burns from the heat flash. EERECI2 DM BAITDIMEZ EIBEZ Alb 10 30 WITE2 EEFECIZ GH EXbOZED bEOLIE 2fMBNBHED 18 10 53 WITE2 BLIZLEBED Ja 10 18 WITEZ Blast The blast wave travels more slowly than the heat flash. Several seconds may pass after you have seen the light or felt the heat before the blast wave reaches you, depending on the distance you are from the explosion. It is like the time between seeing the flash of lightning and hearing the sound of thunder. For example, at ten miles from the centre of an explosion, it would take about 35 seconds for the blast wave to reach you. If caught in the open during a nuclear explosion, this time can be used to find some protection from the blast wave. You might be injured by being thrown about by the blast; therefore, keep low. The greatest danger is from flying glass, bricks and other debris. The blast from a 5-megaton explosion could injure people as far away as 15 miles. The kinds of damage that the blast can do to buildings are: l Complete destruction of all buildings three miles from the centre of the explosion. l Damage beyond repair to buildings three to five miles distant. They would have to be torn down. l Major repairs required to buildings five to 10 miles distant before they could be occupied. l Light to moderate damage to buildings 10 to 15 miles distant. They could be occupied during repairs. A 20-megaton bomb increases the approximate ranges of damage described above to five, eight, sixteen and twenty-four miles. These are approximate distances as the strength of buildings is not uniform. For example, reinforced concrete buildings are more blast resistant than wood frame structures. In some areas four miles away from the explosion, concrete buildings might be repairable, while wood frame buildings would be completely destroyed. Windows, of course, are very vulnerable and are apt to be blown in as far away as 25 miles from the explosion. Radiation 3102 WIFE? 3 WITE2 ‘VT TCHL DYAWCE J HYIOW BEBVIB2 BEOAIBED ‘SS BEAOHD HEBVIE 4 COWDTELE DEZLBACLION A nuclear explosion causes both immediate radiation and residual radiation. Immediate radiation is given off at the time of the explosion. It is dangerous only within two or three miles. If you were near the explosion without adequate protection and managed to survive the effects of blast and fire, you could still be seriously affected by immediate radiation. Residual radiation is given off by the radioactive particles left as \"fallout\" after the explosion. The danger from fallout would be so great and widespread that it is discussed separately, in >Step 2. Protection against Heat, Blast and Immediate Radiation The illustrations below show some of the most probable situations in which you might find yourself at the time of a nuclear attack, and what you should do: vsinig] | 6usiU Step 2: Know the Facts About Radioactive Fallout If a nuclear weapon is exploded on, or near, the ground, danger from radioactive fallout is greatest. The force of the explosion may make a crater up to a mile wide and to a depth of one hundred feet. Millions of tons of pulverized earth, stones, buildings and other materials are drawn up into the fireball and become radioactive. Some of the heavier particles spill out around the point of explosion. The rest are sucked up into the mushroom cloud. This radioactive material is then carried by winds until it settles to earth. This is called \"Fallout\". Under some circumstances you may see the fallout; under others you may not. The radioactivity it gives off cannot be seen. You can\\'t feel it. You can\\'t smell it. But fallout doesn\\'t come out of the sky like a gas and seep into everything. It can best be described as a fine to coarse sand carried by the winds. Because the wind direction varies at different heights above the ground, it is not possible to judge from the ground where the fallout will settle. It can settle in irregular patterns hundreds of miles from the explosion. The fallout from a 5-megaton explosion could affect seriously an area of 7,000 square miles. If nothing were done to gain protection during the period of high radioactivity, there would be a grave danger to life in that area. Because fallout is carried so far and covers such a large area, it could be the greatest danger to the largest number of Canadians in a nuclear war. If Canada was not hit by nuclear bombs, those exploding in the United States close to our border could result in serious fallout in many parts of Canada. There are four things which determine the amount of radiation reaching your body from fallout: 1. The time that has passed since the explosion. 2. The length of time you are exposed to fallout. 3. The distance you are from the fallout. 4. The shielding between you and the fallout. ‘OUBECLION Dk EVITOM YL AYEION2 WFalLndEZ ‘SD\\'0OD EEL ‘80°000 LEEL Time The radioactivity in fallout weakens rapidly in the first hours after an explosion. This weakening is called \"decay\". After seven hours, fallout has lost about 90% of the strength it had one hour after the explosion. After two days it has lost 99%; in two weeks 99.9% of its strength is gone. Nevertheless, if the radiation at the beginning were high enough, the remaining 0.1% could be dangerous. Radiation must be measured by special instruments handled by people trained to use them. But, if you stay in a shelter during the first days following an explosion, you escape the strongest radiation. You should stay in the shelter until radiation has been measured and you have been told aver the radio that it is safe to come out. Distance The strength of radiation reaching your body is reduced the farther you are from the fallout. Here are some illustrations of the safest place to be when you are in various kinds of buildings. 2 HoRBe 3 MEEK2 HYIKYIODH BECVA LIME 1 4one 3 Ronee Shielding The most effective protection is to place some heavy material between yourself and the fallout. The heavier the material the better the protection. Many common materials give excellent protection. The materials and design of the fallout shelter recommended in Blueprint for Survival No. 1 will stop penetration of 99% of outside radiation. These thicknesses of material will stop 99% of radiation: l 16 inches of solid brick l 16 inches of hollow concrete blocks filled with mortar or sand l 2 feet of packed earth Ä 3 feet if loose l 5 inches of steel l 3 inches of lead l 3 feet of water A fallout shelter is the best way to protect your family and yourself against radiation because: VIB BBOIECLION BE2L BBOLECUOM HONZE MUM BYZEWEHL ) ° 1M LHE ObEW HONZE MULH 2HETLEK 27tCH bBOLECLION tas HONZE MUHONL BYZEWEHL l It keeps the radiation at a distance. l It shields you from radiation. l The time spent there is the period when radiation is most intense. By providing your family and yourself with a fallout shelter, you are unlikely to suffer serious effects from radioactive fallout. Personal Danger from Fallout Radioactive particles in contact with your skin for a few hours may produce burns. Follow Step 9 to prevent this danger. Radioactive particles swallowed in food or water might be harmful. Follow Step 9 to prevent this danger. Radioactivity from an area of fallout may produce illness in the unprotected individual after a few days. Follow Step 4 to prevent this danger. Radiation illness develops slowly. It cannot be spread to other people. Except for temporary nausea shortly after exposure, evidence of BVZEWEL 2HIETEINE. HET serious effects from radiation may only appear after an interval of from a few days to three weeks. A combination of loss of hair, loss of appetite, increasing paleness, weakness, diarrhoea, sore throat, bleeding gums and easy bruising indicate that the individual requires medical attention. Nausea and vomiting may be caused by fright, worry, food poisoning, pregnancy and other common conditions. Step 3: Know the Warning Signal and have a Battery-Powered Radio All Canadian communities where there is a likely need are provided, or will be provided, with sirens. Other areas should have warning arrangements based on local systems such as telephones, horns, bells or factory whistles. Warning devices are only attention-getters. Dependent on the size of your municipality, the sirens, bells, telephones, etc., will sound the Attack Warning. There is one type of siren warning signal in Canada: The ATTACK WARNING Signal The ATTACK WARNING Signal: A wailing (undulating) tone on the sirens of three to five minutes duration or short blasts on horns or other devices repeated as necessary means: l An attack on North America has been detected; l Warning of fallout. WHEN YOU HEAR THE WARNING SIGNAL, YOU SHOULD TAKE PROTECTIVE ACTION AND LISTEN TO THE RADIO FOR INSTRUCTIONS. A Radio is Essential When the Attack Warning sounds, you must take protective action. Take a battery-powered radio with you. Broadcast advice and instruction may help to save your life. If you don\\'t have a portable radio, turn up the volume of your house radio so that it can be heard in your shelter. If away from home you are forced to take emergency shelter and are near a radio-equipped vehicle, turn up the volume and open all the vehicle\\'s doors or windows. The Canadian Emergency Broadcasting System, a network of all Canadian radio and television stations which will be formed when a nuclear attack on Canada has been detected, will tell you when and how to take emergency protective action against possible attack and shelter against fallout if an attack occurs. Before Attack If sirens or warning systems signal impending attack, regardless of where you are or what you are doing, you must take the best available cover against the blast, heat and light effects of nuclear explosions. Emergency broadcast instructions will include the following advice: l If you are at home go to the basement or strongest part of your house or building which offers the best protection. If material is handy, improvise blast protection. See Step 4. l Take your battery radio with you, or turn up the house radio so that you can hear it while under cover. l Stay away from windows. l Lie down and protect yourself from flying glass and falling debris. l Shield your eyes from the flash of an explosion. l If you are away from home take protective cover immediately. l If you are travelling, stop and take protective cover immediately, or if you are only a few minutes from a safe destination, proceed and take protective cover immediately. l Listen to your radio for further instructions. After Attack If sirens or warning systems sound following nuclear attacks, the warning may mean another attack or that radioactive fallout is approaching your area. You will be advised over the radio. If the advice concerns fallout, you must take cover against the fallout effects. (See Step 4). Radio broadcasts will identify areas which will be affected by the fallout and give instructions and advice. These might include: l Location of nuclear explosions causing local fallout. l Information about the parts of the country to be affected by fallout. l Length of time before fallout is likely to reach specific communities or areas. l Ways to increase fallout protection. l Supplies to take to your fallout shelter. l Whether it is safer to stay in your community or area, or to go to other areas. l Advice as to which areas are free of danger. l Advice on when to leave shelters and for how long as danger from radioactive contamination diminishes. l Requests for help in rescue operations, such as rescue, firefighting and medical assistance. l Advice on conservation of food, water and fuel. l How to keep warm when power is off and the weather is cold. Don\\'t Use The Telephone When the sirens sound don\\'t use the telephone. Listen to a radio or television for information. In the event of an Attack Warning telephone lines will be required for official use. Step 4: Know How to Take Shelter It is important to provide your family and yourself with a shelter. But what kind of shelter? This is a decision you must make yourself after studying the problem. Study your shelter requirements in the same way that you would study accident or fire insurance. Decide upon the degree of protection you want for your family and yourself. Shelter is your insurance against something you hope will not happen, but if it does, will give you protection. Shelters of the type commonly used in Europe during the Second World War would not provide protection against the blast of a nuclear explosion. They were designed to withstand short shock pressures lasting something like 1/100th of a second. Shelters designed to withstand the pressures created by a nuclear explosion must be able to stand up to pressures lasting as long as 6 seconds. In addition, they must be capable of giving the occupants protection against fires outside the shelter as well as against radiation. The fallout shelter is designed to give protection against radioactive fallout only. Because most people in Canada probably would not be affected by the blast and heat effects of nuclear explosions, protection against fallout is all that is required by them. The type of shelter for good protection depends upon the distance it will be from the explosion. Unfortunately, it is not possible to know this in advance. That is why each individual must make his own decision when selecting the type of shelter he wishes to have. Blueprint for Survival No. 1 gives details of a fallout shelter for the home in which you now live. If you rent the home, the decision to construct a shelter must be taken jointly with your landlord. Blueprint for Survival No. 2 gives details of a fallout shelter for the new home you may be planning to build. Blueprint for Survival No. 6 gives details of blast shelters which may be built outside the home. These pamphlets are available from your local Emergency Measures or Civil Defence Organization. Improvised Protection Against Blast One of the simplest ways to improvise some anti-blast protection is to build a lean -to (bed springs or boards) against a work bench or heavy table, preferably in the basement, and pile mattresses on it and at the ends. If the material is readily available it could be built in a matter of minutes after the ATTACK WARNING is sounded and could protect you from loose bricks, flying glass, etc. If you are in the open and there is a ditch or culvert within easy, quick reach, lie face down in it and cover your face with your arms. Make sure this shelter is not too close to buildings which could collapse into it. \"After\" the blast and heat of the explosion, you would have to find other protection against fallout which will come down later. (Don\\'t forget your battery-powered radio). None of these improvisations is as good as a properly equipped blast shelter, but any single one of them could mean the difference between life and death. Improvised Protection Against Fallout You may not have a fallout shelter when warning of approaching fallout is broadcast. Here are some tips on how to increase your protection in a basement. The amount of protection you can build will depend on how much time you have available until fallout arrives. l You can improvise a small emergency shelter by using furniture, doors, dressers, work-bench and other materials. l Select a corner of your basement, if possible away from windows, in which to build your shelter. Remove inside house doors from hinges to use as a shelter roof over supports. Supports for the improvised roof can be cabinets, chests of drawers, work-bench, or anything which will bear a heavy load. Use the house doors as a roof surface to provide a base for the heavy material you will have to place on it. Bricks, concrete blocks, sand-filled drawers or boxes, books or other dense items on the roof will help reduce radiation penetration. Around the sides and front of your shelter build walls of dense materials to provide vertical shielding. A small cabinet or dirt-filled box as may be used as a crawl-in entrance which can be closed behind you. l Remember, the heavier or more dense the material around you, the greater the protection. l Block basement windows with earth, bricks, concrete blocks, books or even bundles of newspaper. In winter, use packed snow. l On the floor above the corner of the you select as your shelter area, pile any heavy objects you may have available, such as furniture, trunks filled with clothes, dirt-filled boxes, books, newspapers, or earth from outside. l Outside, against above ground walls of the basement around your shelter area heap earth, sand, bricks, concrete blocks or packed snow. If your home has no basement or crawl space, build your emergency shelter in that part of the house (centre hall or clothes closet) farthest away from outside walls and the roof. Build it as described for houses with basements. On the floor immediately above your shelter area, and against surrounding walls, pile up furniture, trunks, dressers, dirtfilled boxes or other heavy material which will reduce radio -active penetration into your emergency shelter. Step 5: Have 14 Days Emergency Supplies Nuclear attacks on centres of production, and fallout conditions, may curtail the distribution of available food stocks for several days or even weeks following these attacks. Persons who had taken shelter against fallout might be advised to stay in their shelters for as long as 14 days. Those who had chosen to evacuate larger cities would be dependent largely on the resources available in reception towns. Because of these possibilities, it is recommended that every person should have emergency supplies. These supplies should include food, water, battery-powered radio, first aid kit, and where necessary, medical supplies as recommended in Step 7. Heavy clothing would be necessary in winter. Extra changes of clothing should be considered particularly stockings and underclothing. For those who may choose to evacuate major centres, supplies must be selected carefully because of space limitation in the family car. Supplies should be packaged beforehand so that they can quickly be put into the car. See the pamphlet \"Your Emergency Pack\" available from your local Emergency Measures or Civil Defence Organization. Many of the recommended items are already in your home. Whether you choose to evacuate or take shelter locally, you should have a road map with you. You could then relate the information about areas under fallout, which you would hear about on the radio, to your actual location. Toys, games, books for your children would help to occupy their time if they had to remain in shelter from fallout. Your battery-powered radio will keep you in contact with the outside world. The following is a suggested list of items from which your two weeks\\' supplies should be developed to be in your shelter or handy to it. Equipment l Beds (bunks or folding) l Bedding l Toilet l Polyethylene bags for toilet l Table (folding or other) l Stools (folding) l Cups and plates (disposable) l Knives, forks, spoons l Can opener l Cooking utensils l Kerosene cooker (Do not use a pressurized stove in the confines of your shelter.) l Kerosene lamp l Kerosene (sufficient for 14 days) l Candles l Safety matches l Hand basin l Calendar l Paper towels l Garbage can (two if no waste water runoff is possible) l Garbage bags l Shovel l Broom l Battery radio and spare batteries l Electric lamp and spare bulbs l Clock l Flashlight and spare batteries l Fire extinguisher l Hand tools l Pocket knife l Axe l String l Light rope Recreational l Books l Paper l Pencils l Playing cards l Chess, checkers, other games l Crosswords, other puzzles l Knitting, sewing, etc. l Hobby materials l Plasticine Toiletries l Soap l Toothpaste l Toothbrushes l Detergent l Nail brush l Razor, blades and soap l Women\\'s basic cosmetics l Tissues (face and toilet) l Face cloth l Towels l Brush and comb Clothing and Personal Items Coveralls, rubber boots, rubber gloves for adults. To be used in venturing outside even after instructions have been given that this is safe for short periods. l Bedding (blankets preferable) l Warm sweaters and socks l Change of underclothing and socks l Personal hygiene items for women l Baby clothes l Baby feeding equipment l Disposable diapers (two-week supply) l Legal papers l Plastic sheeting Medical (See Step 7) Food These are suggested items and amounts for each adult for 14 days in shelter. Check off the items as you stock them in the shelter and mark the purchase date on them. Food stored for emergency use should be used and replaced at least once a year. l Milk: 14 cans (6-oz) or 6 cans (15-oz) evaporated milk or 1-lb dried skim milk l Vegetables: 6 cans (15 or 20-oz) - beans, peas, tomatoes, corn l Fruits: 6 cans (15 or 20-oz) Ä peaches, pears, apple sauce l Juices: 6 cans (20-oz) Ä apple, grapefruit, lemon, orange and tomato l Cereals: 14 individual packages (sealed in wax bags inside or outside) l Biscuits: ¡ 2 packages of crackers (1-lb. each) ¡ 2 packages of cookies or graham wafers l Main Dish Items: ¡ 2 cans meat (12-oz) - corned beef, luncheon meats ¡ 2 cans beef and gravy ¡ 2 cans baked beans (15 or 20-oz) ¡ 2 jars cheese ¡ 2 cans fish (8-oz) l Canned and Dehydrated Soups: 2 cans (10-oz) - bean, pea, tomato, vegetable Other Foods: l 1 large jar or can honey, syrup, jam or marmalade l 2 lbs. hard candy l 1 jar or can peanut butter l 1 package tea bags or instant tea l 1 jar sugar l 1 jar instant coffee l Salt and pepper l Instant chocolate powder l Chewing gum Special Requirements for Children l For each infant include 14 cans evaporated milk (15 oz) and infant food for 14 days. l For each child up to 3 years, include 8 extra cans of milk. l Decrease amounts of other foods according to appetite. l Food for older children can be the same as for adults; adjust amounts according to appetite. Water l Requirements: 7-14 gallons for each adult member of family; more for younger children (some water may be replaced by canned beverages). l Containers: Store in well-cleaned, covered containers such as large thermos jugs, new fuel cans, large bottles, or plastic containers. l Change: Change stored water at least once a month. Step 6: Know How To Prevent And Fight Fires Misinformation about the fire danger from nuclear explosions is widespread and common. For example, some persons believe that the fire- ball would completely incinerate a city. This is not true. The heat from the fire-ball lasts about 15 seconds and would create fires which are no different from the fires you see in peacetime. They can be put out with water and extinguishers, and if each survivor were able to put out a small fire quickly, mass fires would not take place. The heat flash from the fire-ball entering through windows and doors could set fire to curtains, clothes, furniture and paper. Other fires could break out in attics, in backyard trash, on wooden shingles and on the outside of houses built of wood particularly if they are unpainted or weathered. Knowing how to prevent and fight fires at home and at work reduces the number of peacetime fires. The same knowledge will also reduce the number of fires caused by a nuclear explosion. But how can you fight fires in the presence of fallout? From 5 to 15 miles from the centre of the explosion, there will be many survivors. Fallout will not start coming down for about 30 minutes. During this half hour, survivors should inspect their houses and put out all the small fires they can. They must not rely on the fire department to extinguish these fires. You should have in your home and place of work, fire extinguishers, or in an emergency, create a water supply for fire fighting in pails, bathtubs, washtubs, etc. Don\\'t rely on being able to use the established water supply system. Even those who live in areas not attacked may find their fire departments will have to fight major fires elsewhere. Every householder should WHOL MVIEK WMO LOITEL &FA2H AYHK2 bIBIME 24216\" GLNES ENEHEEHCA MeLEH ZnbbIIE learn how to carry out fire prevention and know how to fight small fires. It may prove of value in peacetime! Your local fire authorities are always anxious to advise you on how to fight fires. Attend any emergency fire fighting classes held in your area. Here are some tips for an emergency: l Prepare for emergency by preventing accumulations of trash and rubbish in and around the home. This would include dry leaves and grass, lumber, boxes, cardboard cartons, old unused furniture, bales of newspapers, etc. Keep waste and garbage in covered containers. l The shaking and twisting of buildings and homes due to blast waves in wartime or earthquakes and explosions in peacetime, may break utility inlets at the point they enter the structure. This may allow gas or fuel oil to flow into basements creating a severe hazard. Do not smoke, strike a match, or a lighter, to light your way into a darkened basement. Gas or oil vapours may be present and a violent explosion and fire may result. l To lessen the danger of fires and explosions follow local instructions about shutting off utility services when the ATTACK WARNING sounds. l If you have a coal-burning furnace, or a wood-stove, extinguish it or at least be sure to close all fuel and draft doors. l Close curtains shutters or venetian blinds on all windows and remove furniture from window areas. TO FIGHT AN ORDINARY FIRE: l Take away its fuel. Get the burning material out of your home. l Take away its air. Smother it with a blanket, wet if possible, or a rug. l Cool it with water, earth, sand or fire extinguisher. GAS, OIL, ELECTRICAL FIRES REQUIRE SPECIAL METHODS: l Gas fire: Make sure the gas is shut off and then try to extinguish anything still burning. l Oil fires: Make sure the supply is shut off then smother the fire with earth, sand, rugs or other heavy materialsÄDon\\'t use water. l Electrical fires: Make sure the electricity is shut off then put out the fire. Don\\'t use water if the power is still on. PROMPT ACTION TO PUT OUT SMALL FIRES IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING A NUCLEAR ATTACK WILL SAVE LIVES. Step 7: Know First Aid And Home Nursing The acquisition of First Aid and Home Nursing skills prepares individuals to serve effectively in a national emergency. If such an emergency occurs, the care of many thousands of injured or seriously ill persons becomes a tremendous task for the organized health services. Doctors and nurses may not be readily available to assist you. Thus the importance of First Aid and Home Nursing skills takes on a new dimension. The survival of the injured or sick members of your family may become your responsibility. The main objectives of training individuals in first aid and home nursing are: 1. To preserve life 2. To minimize the effects of injury or illness 3. To relieve suffering or distress 4. To provide continuing care and assist in rehabilitation. Therefore you must: l Know and practice life-saving first aid. l Know and practice simple home nursing measures. First Aid Supplies A simple first aid box kept in your shelter or in your evacuation kit should contain: l 1 bottle mild antiseptic solution (use to clean cuts) l 5 yards 2-inch gauze bandage l 2 triangular bandages (use for slings) l 12 4\" x 4\" sterile pads (use to cover cuts, wounds and burns) l 12 assorted individual adhesive dressins (use for minor cuts) l 2 large dressing pads (shell dressing type) 8\" x 8\" (Available at minimal cost from St. John Ambulance Association) l 5 yards 1/2 inch adhesive tape l 9 assorted safety pins l 1 small bottle toothache drops (for temporary treatment of toothache) l 1 tube of petroleum jelly l 1 small bottle aspirin tablets l 1 thermometer l 1 small scissors (blunt ended) l 1 medicine glass l 1 pair tweezers l 4 oz baking soda and 8 oz table salt (make a drinking solution by adding 1 tsp salt and 1/2 tsp baking soda to 1 qt. of water) l 1 First Aid Manual (St. John Ambulance Association) l 1 Home Nursing Textbook (St. John Ambulance Association and/or Canadian Red Cross Society) l 1 packet paper tissues NOTE: individuals requiring special medication such as insulin should maintain at least 100-days supplies. First Aid Hints General Rules: l Keep calm. l Keep the injured person Iying down in a comfortable position, his head level with his body until you determine whether his injuries are serious. l Examine for stoppage of breathing, serious bleeding or broken bones. These must be treated immediately before any attempt is made to move the injured person. Do not be hurried into this unless you are in a situation of extreme danger. l Keep him comfortably warm with blankets or other coverings, under and above the patient. l Never attempt to give a semi-conscious or unconscious person anything to drink. Unconsciousness: An unconscious patient lying on his back may be strangled by his own tongue which will tend to fall back and obstruct the airway. All unconscious persons should be placed lying half over on their faces, (three -quarter-prone position). If the patient is breathing quietly and easily and his lips are pink and have no froth on them, breathing is not obstructed. If the patient is breathing noisily and with difficulty, if his lips are blue and frothing, or if his chest is sucked inwards when he breathes in, his airway is obstructed and needs immediate attention. Keep the airway clear by: Placing the casualty on his back; supporting his shoulders on a pad of any suitable material available; tilting the head back with one hand on the forehead, the other lifting the neck. If his breathing stops you can breathe for the patient by blowing air into his lungs. Take a deep breath. Pinch the casualty\\'s nostrils. Place mouth to mouth tightly. Blow into the casualty\\'s lungs strongly enough to cause his chest to rise. The cycle should be repeated every 3 to 5 seconds for an adult and a little more frequently for a child. Blow more gently for a child or a baby, but strongly enough to make the chest rise. Wounds: You Must: l Stop bleeding (haemorrhage) l Keep out germs (infection) Cover the wound with a clean dressing to keep out dirt and germs. Bandage it on firmly to stop the bleeding. If a wound is bleeding profusely, hold it firmly with your hand until you can secure an emergency dressing. Any thick pad of clean, soft, compressible material large enough to cover the wound will make a good dressing. Clean handkerchiefs, towels, sanitary pads, tissue handkerchiefs or sheets make good emergency dressings. Burns: Cover the burned area with large, thick, dry dressing and bandage it on firmly. Encourage the casualty to drink plenty of fluids. A solution of salt and soda is useful to give to casualties with burns and to those who have suffered from serious bleeding. Broken bones (fractures): If a limb is very painful and cannot be used, appears to be bent in the wrong place or the casualty says he heard or felt the bone snap, it is likely that a bone is broken. Sharp ends of a broken bone may damage important structures such as blood vessels and nerves. A broken limb should be steadied and supported to prevent movement of the broken ends before attempting to move the patient. If a person\\'s back or neck is so severely injured that he is afraid to move because of pain, or cannot move or feel his limbs, you should assume that he has a broken back. He should be moved on a hard, firm stretcher taking great care not to \"jack-knife\" him by picking up his feet and shoulders. Improvised stretchers can be made from a door, wide board, window shutter, etc. Fill in the natural hollows of the track and neck with padding and support the head on both sides to prevent movement. DO NOT: l Put strong antiseptics into a wound. l Use a tourniquet. BIEEDIME EBOW EBEZH MOAMD BYEEDIME COWLBOITED BA BEEZ2NBE EBOM MONKD BTO00 E2CYbINE BBEZ2NBE l Remove clothing which is stuck to a burn. l Break any blisters or apply creams or grease to a large burn. l Give anything by mouth to a semi-conscious patient, or to a patient with internal abdominal wounds. HOME NURSING HINTS Before medical or nursing help becomes available you may also encounter infant care problems. emotional problems and persons suffering from radiation sickness. What to observe, and what to do for these latter cases, is outlined below. Infant Care Breast feeding is preferable but, if not possible, then a formula using powdered or evaporated milk should be prepared under clean conditions. If vomiting or diarrhoea occurs infants and children become dehydrated very quickly. To avoid this happening give frequent sips of boiled water. If a rash or fever develops, keep others away from the sick child. Emotional Problems Persons who become emotionally disturbed following a disaster should be treated calmly but firmly. They should be kept in small groups, preferably with persons whom they know and encouraged to \"talk out\" their problem. If they are not otherwise injured they should be given something to do. It may be necessary to enlist the aid of one other calm person to help subdue the overexcited patient. If a stunned or dazed reaction persists over 6 to 8 hours this should be reported to a doctor or nurse immediately one becomes available. Radiation Sickness The signs and symptoms of this illness are described in Step 2. Treatment includes rest, the provision of whatever nutritional food and drink is available and personal encouragement to get well. Swab the mouth gently with mild, warm salt and water if it becomes sore. As these patients are susceptible to infection, keep wounds clean and covered with a sterile dressing. Separate these patients from persons with colds, rash or fever. Improvised Equipment The following suggestions may help you care for your patient when proper equipment is not available. l Bed: A couch, mattress or any well padded, firm surface; if too low raise on bricks, boxes or wooden blocks. l Bedding Protection: Old crib pads cut into a convenient size and placed over a waterproof sheeting; or several layers of newspaper and heavy brown paper covered with old soft cotton. (Never use thin plastic if patient is a child.) l Backrest: A straight-backed chair turned upside down at head of bed and securely tied to bed; a triangular bolster or cushions from a chair or chesterfield. l Bed Cradle: A light wooden box or firm cardboard carton approximately 10 x 12 x 24 inches, with two sides removed; or a hoop sawn in half and the two pieces joined together in the centre. l Pressure Pads: Soft cushion or foam or sponge rubber pads will protect heels, elbows, back of head or any other body pressure point. l Bedpan or Urinal: For bedpan use a padded dish or pan; for urinal any wide-necked bottle or jar. l Hot Water Bottle: A heated brick wrapped in several layers of newspaper. START TRAINING NOW! ONE PERSON IN EVERY FAMILY SHOULD BE TRAINED IN FIRST AID AND/OR HOME NURSING. Courses in these skills are available in most municipalities from your local St. John Ambulance Association or Canadian Red Cross Society. REGISTER NOW! Step 8: Know Emergency Cleanliness Your limited supply of water will have to be rationed and used only for essential purposes. If you have enough warning time before the arrival of fallout, fill your bathtub, all available buckets and pans with water. And remember that there is an emergency supply in your hot water tank. (Don\\'t forget this if in peacetime your water supply has been temporarily disrupted). The problems of garbage and human waste disposal can be solved even if fallout keeps you in the shelter. Put all your garbage in tightly covered garbage pails. After using your emergency toilet, you should tie human waste in waterproof plastic (polyethylene) bags and place them in the garbage pail. Store a 14-day supply of the plastic bags. After the second day in the shelter, you may risk leaving it for a few minutes for essential tasks. Therefore, when your garbage container is filled, move it out of the shelter. Keep a soft broom in the shelter for tidying it up. Remember, personal cleanliness in crowded shelter conditions is important to you and your family. If your area is free of fallout but is without sewage services, bury human waste and garbage in the ground. Dig the pit deep enough so that the waste will be covered by at least two feet of earth. Step 9: Know How To Get Rid Of Radioactive Dust In Step 2, fallout was described as \"sand\". To remove the danger, remove the sand. If you suspect that your clothes have fallout on them, remove your outer clothing before you come inside your home and leave it outside. Don\\'t shake these clothes inside the house or shelter. You would only scatter the fallout grit and create unnecessary danger to others. If you have water, wash thoroughly, particularly exposed skin and hair. But do not scrub your skin as this might rub in the radioactive particles. Exposure to fallout does not make you radioactive. Even if you are stricken with radiation sickness, this sickness cannot be passed on to others. Fallout on your clothing or body would expose you and those close to you to radiation. If you suspect you have been exposed to fallout, you will not be a danger to others if you carefully get rid of your outer clothing outside the shelter and wash. ¥2 2ONKCE & MYER tM Brv2di WHOL M¥LEW LYM HOM MEZIE ie? Food and Water Since most of your food will be in tightly covered containers (cans, bottles, plastic, boxes), it will all be safe to eat or drink if you dust the containers. Food, if it is unspoiled and free of grit or dust, may be eaten during the emergency period. Be sure to wash fruit and vegetables and peel carefully. Water will be safe if it is in covered containers, or if it has come from covered wells, or from undamaged water systems. Step 10: Know Your Municipal Plan It is important that your local municipality have a plan for a war emergency. And it is just as important that you know that plan. Over the past several years, provincial and municipal governments, with the assistance of federal authorities, have been steadily developing plans for the protection of the population and the continuity of essential government services in wartime. Most municipalities in Canada have emergency plans to deal with both peacetime disasters and a nuclear attack situation. These include the details of how welfare, health, police, public utilities, fire and other emergency services will operate. Some larger communities have developed plans to assist in the evacuation of those who would choose to leave before an attack or who might have to be evacuated as survivors or casualties following an attack. These plans include traffic arrangements to reception centres and medical facilities in nearby communities. It would be unwise to try and prepare your own family survival plan without first checking to see how it fits in with municipal plans. This would be true whether you plan to go to a safer area before attack or remain at home. It is particularly important that you know and understand the arrangements to instruct the public about staying in shelter and coming out of shelter when it is safe. Fallout is a health hazard which will require countermeasures for personal and family protection including assessment of radiation and advice and instructions to those in shelter. There must be close understanding and cooperation between the public and municipal authorities responsible for their protection. Find out about your municipal emergency plans now and keep well informed about them as they are further developed. Step 11: Have A Plan For Your Family And Yourself If you know what is contained in the first nine steps, and you know your municipal plan for a war emergency, you should now make your personal and family survival plan. The success of your plan will depend on how many of the suggested recommendations you carry out. Your chances of survival increase as you carry out each recommendation. Thinking about the problems with which you would be faced should nuclear attack be launched against North America is the first important step. Blast, light, heat and radioactive fallout are the problems. A workable survival plan will include all of the preparations you can make in advance to meet those problems. In making that plan, there are certain things you must know: When to take protective action When the sirens or other warning devices sound and your local broadcast station confirms that an attack on North America has been detected it means that you must take protective action immediately. Would you and your family l Recognize the Attack Warning signal ? l Turn on the radio or television and listen for instructions? Where to take shelter Deciding where you will take initial protective action and where you and your family will seek shelter from fallout are two basic points which you must consider in making your survival plan. Can you answer the following questions about seeking immediate protection and shelter: l Have you decided where you will take shelter if you\\'re not at home when the Attack Warning sounds? l Will you try to get home? l Will your family know what to do if you are not at home? l Is there a shelter plan for your children at school? l Do you want them to try to get home? l Does everybody in your family know your survival plan? In thinking about what you will do or where you would go, you might consider leaving your home to find shelter elsewhere. Before you decide to plan on evacuation, consider the following questions: l Will protection there be better than in your home? l Are there sufficient supplies there? l Can you carry emergency supplies for 14 days? l Do you know how to get there quickly? How to take shelter If you don\\'t have a fallout shelter built in your home, study the guide given in Step 4. It shows how you can improvise emergency home protection. Bearing in mind that density and distance between you and the fallout is necessary, try to estimate if there is enough material and furniture to build an emergency shelter in your basement or the central part of your house. l Can you move it to where it will be needed quickly? l Will you have the help you require? Based on the lists of emergency supplies suggested in Steps 5, 6, 7 and 8, try to answer the following questions: l Do you have them at home? l Can you collect and move them to the shelter area quickly? l Does your emergency cooker, lamp, flashlight, radio work? l Have you containers for water, garbage, hygiene? l DO YOU HAVE A BATTERY RADIO AND SPARE BATTERIES? There are many other points which you and your family must resolve for a workable survival plan. This booklet provides most of the essential information on which to base your plans. Read the Steps again, and, as you review each Step, try to answer the questions which apply to your surroundings, your home, your family. Here are a few more which may help: l Do I know the recommended fire precautions? l Does anyone in my family know how to fight small fires? l Can an emergency supply of water be obtained quickly - for fire fighting? for personal use? l Are first aid supplies and special medicines readily available? l Does anyone in my family know how to render fist aid? l Can materials for personal hygiene and cleanliness be gathered near the shelter area quickly? l Do I know what I must do about radioactive dust? l Do I know the emergency plans of my municipality - for public shelters? for planned evacuation routes? for schools, hospitals, welfare centres? other special instructions? REMEMBER! YOU MUST PLAN FOR: l PROTECTIVE ACTION WHEN WARNED OF ATTACK and l PROVISION OF SHELTER AGAINST THE EFFECTS OF FALLOUT On the basis of what you\\'ve read and the questions and answers you\\'ve thought about, you should now make your survival plan and start making whatever arrangements you can. BUT MAKE SURE THAT ALL MEMBERS OF YOUR FAMILY KNOW YOUR PLAN AND WHAT TO DO WHEN THE TIME COMES. The best way to arrive at a workable plan which will be remembered by your family is to practice it. If you plan on building an emergency shelter, try it now to find out if you have enough material, how much help you\\'ll need, if your proposed area is large enough, and how long it will take to build. Locate and practice moving essential supplies, water, clothing, bedding, etc. Practice the essential things you would have to do. If you plan to move to what you consider a safer location, make a practice run to make sure you know the quickest and safest route, that protection is available when you get there, and that you can carry all the supplies you think you\\'ll need.

Set on the stove and bring to a boil. Once it\\'s boiling, turn the burner to low and simmer lightly for 30 minutes. After it has finished simmering, turn the burner off, leave the lid on and let it steep for 1 hour. Strain off the liquid from all the spices and berries. I like to use a muslin cloth so that I can squeeze more of the liquid out. Give the spices and berries to your chickens or compost it. Elderberry Syrup 2 cups dried elderberries 4 cups water 1 cinnamon stick 1 tsp dried clove 1/4 cup dried rose hips 1/4 cup dried astragalus root 3 tbsp grated fresh ginger Raw honey Measure the elderberry liquid by ounces and add 50% of that amount of your raw honey. So if you have 16oz of elderberry then add 8oz of honey. Stir it up well and store in a glass mason jar in the refrigerator. Dosage: 1 tablespoon daily for adults 1 teaspoon daily for kids Ear Infection Remedy My mom used this remedy on us kids growing up and I have carried on the tradition with my own kids. It\\'s truly the best ear infection remedy I\\'ve ever tried. Garlic & Olive oil. Take two spoons and a fresh clove of garlic. Use the spoons and smash the garlic between them. Get it nice and mashed up and juicy. Pour a little cold pressed virgin olive oil into the spoon over the garlic. Heat over the burner until its starting to bubble. Let it cool. Using a little baby medicine syringe pull some up out of the spoon. Put 1 to 2 drops in the infected ear every couple hours until symptoms resolve. x Unfltereg C. Extra Virgin Olive Oil FALL 2027 1g 15 2024 DEC 31 2023 nt. 16.9 flog. (500m) |. Kidney Infection Remedy I have had several kidney infections over the years, most of them when I am early postpartum and my body is weaker. Over the years I have discovered the best remedies for getting rid of this infection FAST without having to take antibiotics. Remedy 1: Activated charcoal. Take 4 capsules of activated charcoal every hour or two until the symptoms disappear. I take two more doses even after that to make sure it\\'s gone. Make sure to drink a lot of water with them because charcoal can make you constipated. Remedy 2: Herbal tea. Drink a cup of peppermint and lemon balm tea once or twice a day. Lemon balm is a natural antiseptic. Peppermint has antibacterial and antispasmodic properties and it can help promote urination, which helps flush out the infection-causing bacteria. Drinking tea also increases your water intake which flushes out the infection as the charcoal binds it. 90 CAPSULES | Remedy 1: Dmannose. Take 2 capsules (2500mg total) of dmannose every 2 to 3 hours until symptoms resolve. Make sure to drink lots of water. The dmannose makes the infection release from the bladder wall and then you have to drink a lot of water to flush the infection out. UTI Remedy Remedy 2: Dried cornsilk. I harvest corn we grow in our garden, or from other local organic farms. I then dry it in the dehydrator and store in a glass mason jar, and make a tea with it for UTIs. Simply take two teaspoons of this herb and steep in boiling water for ten to fifteen minutes before drinking. You can drink this tea up to three times daily. Remedy 3: Vitamin C. Take 2 capsules of vitamin C a few times throughout the day with lots of water. I use an acerola cherry vitamin C capsule for a natural form of the vitamin. Plantain Remedy Method 1: Use it fresh. The easiest way to use plantain is freshly picked. As soon as one of your family members gets a wasp sting or spider bite, just head out to the yard and harvest a couple leaves. Chew it up and stick right on the bite. You can use a band aid or something to hold it there for awhile so the herb has time to draw the poison out. There are so many amazing benefits from this so-called \"weed\". This is one of my favorite things for drawing out poisons. It is the best remedy of all time for wasp stings, spider bites, etc! Method 2: Make a tincture. Of course if you live somewhere that gets cold in the winter this won\\'t be available all year long to use fresh. So it\\'s a good idea to make a tincture to have on hand all year. Rip the plantain leaves by hand, or grind them in a mortar and pestle (wet or dry), and add them to a sterilized jar. Pour vodka (grain or potato-based) or brandy (fruit-based), or even apple cider vinegar (raw with the mother) in a 2:1 ratio (2 parts alcohol, 1 part fresh plantain). Label the jar and seal with a tight-fitting lid. Leave it to sit for 4-6 weeks in a dark place. Strain the leaves out and the tincture is ready to use. You can use as needed once it\\'s done, place topically on the bite or sting. Tooth Remedy I\\'ve had several cavities over the last couple years because of how close my pregnancies were, so I\\'ve discovered quite a few tips for healing and re-mineralizing. (only for minor cavities, if they have decayed too far down there isn\\'t as much that can be done naturally) Remedy 1: Prevention with vitamins, minerals and diet. The first and most important step is to work on replenishing your body and re-mineralizing your teeth. For awhile I took a mineral supplement, shilajit and vitamin K daily to re-mineralize. Now I\\'m healed enough that I just take minerals and shilajit in my daily multivitamin, and don\\'t have to add extra. Vitamin A - Supports the proper development of facial structure and oral mucusol tissues. Calcium - Increases bone density. Vitamin K - Helps move the calcium into the bones and teeth. Vitamin D - We need this for our bodies to absorb calcium. We can get a lot of those vitamins through eating an ancestral diet. So being really sure to eat organ meats, fermented cod liver oil, bone broth, bone marrow, raw milk, raw cheese, fermented foods, grass-fed meat, local bee pollen, grass-fed butter and other healthy fats. Your tooth health starts in the gut. A note on the cholesterol myth: don\\'t be afraid of cholesterol and saturated fats! It is important for synthesizing Vitamin D from sunlight. Remedy 2: Black Walnut Extract. Black walnut extract can be super helpful for actually healing minor cavities. I use two droppers in a little bit of water. Slosh around for a little while and then swallow. I do it after each meal and once before bed. Remedy 3: Use the right toothpaste. I would not ever use fluoride toothpaste. Using one with hydroxyapatite accomplishes the same thing but it\\'s actually safe to use, unlike fluoride. As well as mixing in other re- mineralizing things. Here is a list of things I use: Hydroxyapatite Toothpaste (code WILSON10) Prebiotic Toothpaste Re-mineralizing Charcoal Tooth Powder Super Re-mineralizing Ozonated Tooth Putty (code WILSONFAMILYHOMESTEAD) so ers as General Detox With our world being so full of toxins it\\'s important for most people to do some form of detoxing, so their bodies can release all those toxins and not have them sitting in their bodies causing more harm. But remember, go slow with detoxing, don\\'t add every single thing at once. Remedy 1: Coffee Enema. Using a coffee enema is a really great way to help your liver detox! You need to get special mold-free coffee beans and an enema kit. I use distilled water and our french press to brew this. Three Tbsp. for a quart of water, brew for 5 minutes, and then press. Let it cool in a mason jar, then pour into the enema bag. You want to go slow with this so you don\\'t get bad cramping. Once it\\'s all inside, set the timer for 15 minutes and watch something to distract yourself. Breathe deeply if it\\'s cramping, and don\\'t feel bad if you can\\'t hold it for the full 15 minutes. Remedy 2: Infrared Sauna. Sweating while sitting still (vs. sweating while working out) is a wonderful way to detox your body, especially your lymphatic system. It\\'s pulling toxins out through your skin with your sweat. You experience a productive sweat from your cells as the infrared waves go deep into your skin, and heat your core to expel toxins, rather than just sitting in hot, ambient air that only heats your outer skin. Remedy 3: Castor Oil Packs. A castor oil pack will loosen build-up in the digestive tract and allow you to eliminate excess toxins. I like it especially for helping the liver to detox. I use some really absorbent cloth, you keep reusing this cloth each time and throw away when it\\'s too dirty, and I just keep it in a mason jar in between packs. Soak the cloth well with castor oil. Put the castor oil soaked cloth on your abdomen over your liver. Place a waterproof towel or plastic wrap over top of it. Then place a heating pack on top of that and turn it on high, or medium if that\\'s too hot for you. Let it sit for about an hour. Take it off, put the castor oil cloth in a jar for next time, and wipe off your stomach where all the oil is. You can do this a few times a week or as infrequently as once or twice a month. Remedy 4: Milk Thistle. I use milk thistle capsules whenever I am doing a detox to help my liver expel more toxins and also protect it from any damage. It can help the detox be more gentle on your body but also more effective. Take 1 capsule about 30 minutes before starting one of your detox regimens. Kidney Stones I had a bout of kidney stones after my second baby was born - another one of those things that made me realize the importance of taking extra good care of my body in pregnancy and not stressing my body out so much. Remedy 1: Chanca Piedra. This herbal tincture helps break up stones. I took 1 dropper in a little water, 3 times a day until the stones passed. Remedy 2: Lemon Juice. Lemon juice is something that can help shrink the stones, making them easier to pass. Add a couple ounces of lemon juice to your water that you drink through the day. The more you can tolerate the better. Remedy 3: Lots of Water. Water is super important for passing stones. It helps flush them out and being hydrated also helps prevent more stones from forming. Remedy 4: Super Phosphozyme Supplement. These capsules are very effective at dissolving stones. When I had gallbladder stones I took 4 a day for 3 days. When I had kidney stones I took 3 a day for 3 days and then down to 1 a day for another three days. It is very helpful to work with a muscle tester when taking this, because you don\\'t want to take too much or for too long. Take 2 hours after food and 1 hour before food because it rids the stomach of acid. Wart Remedy Years ago I had a super stubborn wart on one of my fingers that refused to leave no matter what I tried Until I learned about this remedy somewhere and tried it, and it finally made that horrible thing disappear for good! Thuja Essential Oil & Ozonated Olive Oil. Place a drop of Thuja Essential Oil on the wart, then smear a very small amount of the Ozonated Olive Oil over that. Then put a bandaid over that. You don\\'t want it open to the air, that seems to make it grow back. Keeping it covered and moist is going to make those things penetrate deeper into the wart to kill it. Repeat the process once a day until the wart is gone. Every now and then, as the top of the wart dies, you can use a clipper to cut off the top, that lets you get even deeper, faster with the remedy. This can take a long time, so don\\'t give up hope! I also recommend doing it for another few weeks after you think it\\'s gone. Headache Remedies Remedy 1: Leefy Prana. Leefy Prana is a tincture we use for it\\'s amazing anti- inflammatory properties. It has organic turmeric root, organic ginger root, and organic black pepper fruit. Using any of those separately or in another from can help too. Relieving inflammation can help with minor headaches as well as migraines. Remedy 2: Kali Phosphoricum. This is a homeopathic remedy that relieves tension headaches. I dissolve 5 pellets under my tongue up to 3 times during a day. Remedy 3: Peppermint Essential Oil. Peppermint essential oil has a very cooling and soothing effect. I drop some on my fingers and carefully rub it on my temples, forehead, and the back of my neck. Be careful not to get it near your eyes. Remedy 4: Hydrate. Sometimes headaches are just because we aren\\'t hydrated well at a cellular level. Just chugging plain water won\\'t help all the time, so adding a little pinch of mineral salt to your water actually helps make sure your cells are being hydrated and the water isn\\'t just flushing your minerals away. Diarrhea Remedies These are some remedies for temporary diarrhea. If you are having on-going diarrhea it is time to look for a deeper root cause. Gut imbalance, colon issues, microbiome, there are so many things that could cause it. So I\\'d recommend going to see a naturopath and/or kinesiologist. Remedy 1: Activated Charcoal. Activated charcoal is actually something that can make you constipated if you\\'re taking it for an infection and you don\\'t drink enough water with it. So it can be helpful to temporarily relieve the symptoms of diarrhea. Remedy 2: Podophyllum Peltatum. This is a homeopathic that relieves diarrhea with intestinal growling and pain. Take 5 pellets, hold under the tongue until they dissolve, up to 3 times a day. Remedy 3: Cinchona Officinalis. This is a homeopathic that relieves diarrhea with gas and bloating. Take 5 pellets, hold under the tongue until they dissolve, up to 3 times a day. Remedy 4: Probiotic Yogurt (or Kefir). Yogurt contains bifidobacterium and lactobacillus acidophilus, which are useful for reducing diarrhea. Also, these good bacteria are high in lactic acid, and can be really effective for treating diarrhea. Constipation Remedies Remedy 1: Prunes or Prune Juice. Eat a few prunes or drink a cup of prune juice to loosen things up. This remedy is my favorite for kiddos because they don\\'t mind drinking the juice. Remedy 2: Magnesium Citrate. This form of magnesium can have a laxative effect so that\\'s why I don\\'t like it for general magnesium intake, but it is very effective at loosening up stools, so I keep a bottle on hand just incase. General Cold & Flu Support Remedy 1: Elderberry Syrup. Take extra of your elderberry syrup. Recipe on page 6. Remedy 2: Vitamin C. We take the real food vitamin C: Acerola powder when we are sick to help our immune systems start to fight off the cold. It is a powerful anti-oxidant and it also helps increase the absorption of the nutrients taken in through our food. So it helps give our bodies more defenses during a sickness. Remedy 3: Sublingual Sprays. I like to use sublingual sprays when we are sick as well. They are easy for kids to take and can be really helpful for anyone with gut issues because the vitamins enter the bloodstream in minutes and bypass the gut. I have on hand C, D, and B sprays. The C spray has zinc, acerola (vit C), echinacea, and elderberry, so it\\'s a wonderful immune support to have on hand!! Link on page 4. Remedy 4: Extra Hydration and Bone Broth. It\\'s really important to make sure you are staying hydrated while sick. Drink mineral water to re-hydrate your cells. We like to have homemade bone broth on hand for sipping on also. It is hydrating and it\\'s also giving your body protein, minerals and other nutrients important for healing. Remedy 5: Wet Sock Treatment. This may sound like a strange one, but using this treatment helps increase circulation which stimulates the immune system and decreases congestion in the upper respiratory passages, head and throat. Start right at the onset of an illness and repeat for 3 nights in a row. First take a nice warm bath, then get ready for bed. Soak some cotton socks in ice water, then ring out and put them on your feet. Layer a nice thick dry pair of wool socks on top of the wet cotton socks. Go to sleep and allow it to increase your circulation and work it\\'s magic. Remedy 6: Lower Intake of Processed Foods and Sugars. Eating processed sugary foods during a sickness, like store- bought ice cream, can feed the bad bacteria and make it harder for your body to heal. Eat lots of grassfed meat, lacto fermented foods, bone broth, bone marrow, raw dairy, to give yourself the proper nutritional support. Remedy 7: Argentyn 23. This is a Professional Bio-Active Silver Hydrosol. It has positively charged silver ions and is very effective for immune system support. For short term use during a sickness, take 1 tsp 5 to 7 times a day (only 1/2 tsp for children). Remedy 8: Boiron Oscillococcinum. This is a homeopathic remedy for flu symptoms for the whole family. Adults and children 2 years an older dissolve entire contents of one tube in the mouth every 6 hours, up to 3 times a day. Remedy 9: Bee Propolis. Bee propolis spray supports your immune system with antioxidants, vitamin C, zinc, iron, B vitamins, and over 300 other beneficial compounds. It naturally contains flavonoids and polyphenols that fight free radicals and combat oxidative stress. It\\'s also amazing for soothing a sore throat. Fevers My general rule is to just let fevers be if I can. It is your body\\'s natural and effective way of killing whatever virus is attacking. But if they get too high (over 102F) then I have a few remedies on hand to help. The first line of defense is always eating nourishing foods and staying hydrated. Remedy 1: Boiron Aconitum Napellus. This is a homeopathic remedy for high fevers. Dissolve 5 pellets under the tongue 3 times a day until symptoms resolve. Remedy 2: Chiropractic Adjustments. During a fever and illness, a chiropractic adjustment can remove some of the stress and interference the central nervous system may be experiencing by getting the spine aligned. When the spine is aligned, the body should be much more efficient and stronger. Remedy 3: Dr. Talbot\\'s Homeopathic Pain + Fever Relief Liquid Medicine. I use this homeopathic liquid for my kiddos when they have a high fever. I use this instead of tylenol. Tylenol we have on hand only for dire emergencies. Remedy 1: Eat Right Away. I find personally that the nausea gets much worse when I let myself get hungry. So eating a little something right away in the morning really helps. Even if it\\'s just a little cup of raw milk. Morning Sickness Remedy 2: Magnesium. Sometimes pregnancy sickness can be made worse by magnesium deficiency. So taking a magnesium supplement is helpful. Either a topical magnesium oil spray like from Ancient Minerals. Or a magnesium glycinate capsule. Remedy 3: Ginger and Peppermint. Sipping on either ginger or peppermint tea through the day is super helpful. Both of those things relive nausea very effectively. Remedies for Varicose Veins Some things that can help prevent varicose veins or improve current ones are: Applying Cypress Infused Oil, Vitamin E, Magnesium Oil and Witch Hazel topically on the varicose veins. Apply a fresh poultice of comfrey, yarrow, and mullein. Varicose Veins Take medical grade liquid Collagen, get adequate Copper intake, take Quercetin, Vitamin K, Vitamin E, and Magnesium. Drink nettle and parsley tea. Get consistent exercise, including brisk walking. Leg inversions can help as well, do inverted yoga poses as well. Remove seed oils. Avoid crossing your legs, wearing knee length socks, tight clothing, or high heeled shoes, and straining too hard on the toilet. Thank you for reading!

Install a smoke alarm outside each sleeping area and on each additional level of your home. If people sleep with doors closed, install smoke alarms inside sleeping areas, too. Use the test button to check each smoke alarm once a month. When necessary, replace batteries immedi- ately. Replace all batteries at least once a year. Vacuum away cobwebs and dust from your smoke alarms monthly. Smoke alarms become less sensitive over time. Replace your smoke alarms every ten years. Consider having one or more working fire extinguishers in your home. Get training from the fire department in how to use them. Consider installing an automatic fire sprinkler system in your home. Escape safely Once you are out, stay out! Call the fire department from a neigh- bor’s home. If you see smoke or fire in your first escape route, use your second way out. If you must exit through smoke, crawl low under the smoke to your exit. If you are escaping through a closed door, feel the door before opening it. If it is warm, use your second way out. If smoke, heat, or flames block your exit routes, stay in the room with the door closed. Signal for help using a bright-colored cloth at the window. If there is a tele- phone in the room, call the fire department and tell them where you are. Your local contact is: Are You Ready for a Fire? Here’s what you can do to prepare for such an emergency Fire Plan your escape routes Determine at least two ways to escape from every room of your home. Consider escape ladders for sleep- ing areas on the second or third floor. Learn how to use them and store them near the window. Select a location outside your home where everyone would meet after escaping. Practice your escape plan at least twice a year. Fire is one of the most common disasters. Fire causes more deaths than any other type of disaster. But fire doesn’t have to be deadly if you have early warning from a smoke detector and everyone in your family knows how to escape calmly. Please be serious about the responsibility of planning for and practicing what to do in case of a fire. Be prepared by having various household members do each of the items on the checklist below. Then get together to discuss and finalize your personal Fire Plan. ____ Install smoke alarms outside each sleeping area and on each additional level of your residence. Keep new batteries on hand. New smoke alarms installed; batteries purchased: ___________________________________________________ (date) ____ Test smoke alarms once a month.

Sept. 1998 --- Content from Copy of Are You Ready_ --- 179 5 Recovering from Disaster Recovering from Disaster 5.0 Are You Ready? 180 Health and Safety Guidelines Recovering from a disaster is usually a gradual process. Safety is a primary issue, as are mental and physical well-being. If assistance is available, knowing how to ac- cess it makes the process faster and less stressful. This section offers some general advice on steps to take after disaster strikes in order to begin getting your home, your community, and your life back to normal. Your ﬁ rst concern after a disaster is your family’s health and safety. You need to consider possible safety issues and monitor family health and well-being. Aiding the Injured Check for injuries. Do not attempt to move seriously injured persons unless they are in immediate danger of death or further injury. If you must move an uncon- scious person, ﬁ rst stabilize the neck and back, then call for help immediately. If the victim is not breathing, carefully position the victim for artiﬁ cial respi- ration, clear the airway, and commence mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Maintain body temperature with blankets. Be sure the victim does not be- come overheated. Never try to feed liquids to an unconscious person. Health Be aware of exhaustion. Don’t try to do too much at once. Set priorities and pace yourself. Get enough rest. Drink plenty of clean water. Eat well. Wear sturdy work boots and gloves. Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and clean water often when working in debris. Safety Issues Be aware of new safety issues created by the disaster. Watch for washed out roads, contaminated buildings, contaminated water, gas leaks, broken glass, damaged electrical wiring, and slippery ﬂ oors. Inform local authorities about health and safety issues, including chemical spills, downed power lines, washed out roads, smoldering insulation, and dead animals. Recovering from Disaster 5.0 Are You Ready? 181 Recovering from Disaster Returning Home Returning home can be both physically and mentally challenging. Above all, use caution. General tips: Keep a battery-powered radio with you so you can listen for emergency up- dates and news reports. Use a battery-powered ﬂ ash light to inspect a damaged home. Note: The ﬂ ashlight should be turned on outside before entering—the bat- tery may produce a spark that could ignite leaking gas, if present. Watch out for animals, especially poisonous snakes. Use a stick to poke through debris. Use the phone only to report life-threatening emergencies. Stay off the streets. If you must go out, watch for fallen objects; downed elec- trical wires; and weakened walls, bridges, roads, and sidewalks. Before You Enter Your Yome Walk carefully around the outside and check for loose power lines, gas leaks, and structural damage. If you have any doubts about safety, have your residence in- spected by a qualiﬁ ed building inspector or structural engineer before entering. Do not enter if: You smell gas. Floodwaters remain around the building. Your home was damaged by ﬁ re and the authorities have not declared it safe. Going Inside Your Home When you go inside your home, there are certain things you should and should not do. Enter the home carefully and check for damage. Be aware of loose boards and slippery ﬂ oors. The following items are other things to check inside your home: Recovering from Disaster 5.0 Are You Ready? 182 Natural gas. If you smell gas or hear a hissing or blowing sound, open a window and leave immediately. Turn off the main gas valve from the outside, if you can. Call the gas company from a neighbor’s residence. If you shut off the gas supply at the main valve, you will need a professional to turn it back on. Do not smoke or use oil, gas lanterns, candles, or torches for lighting inside a damaged home until you are sure there is no leaking gas or other ﬂ ammable materials present. Sparks, broken or frayed wires. Check the electrical system unless you are wet, standing in water, or unsure of your safety. If possible, turn off the elec- tricity at the main fuse box or circuit breaker. If the situation is unsafe, leave the building and call for help. Do not turn on the lights until you are sure they’re safe to use. You may want to have an electrician inspect your wiring. Roof, foundation, and chimney cracks. If it looks like the building may col- lapse, leave immediately. Appliances. If appliances are wet, turn off the electricity at the main fuse box or circuit breaker. Then, unplug appliances and let them dry out. Have appliances checked by a professional before using them again. Also, have the electrical system checked by an electrician before turning the power back on. Water and sewage systems. If pipes are damaged, turn off the main water valve. Check with local authorities before using any water; the water could be contaminated. Pump out wells and have the water tested by authorities before drinking. Do not ﬂ ush toilets until you know that sewage lines are intact. Food and other supplies. Throw out all food and other supplies that you sus- pect may have become contaminated or come in to contact with ﬂ oodwater. Your basement. If your basement has ﬂ ooded, pump it out gradually (about one third of the water per day) to avoid damage. The walls may collapse and the ﬂ oor may buckle if the basement is pumped out while the surrounding ground is still waterlogged. Open cabinets. Be alert for objects that may fall. Clean up household chemical spills. Disinfect items that may have been con- taminated by raw sewage, bacteria, or chemicals. Also clean salvageable items. Call your insurance agent. Take pictures of damages. Keep good records of repair and cleaning costs. Recovering from Disaster 5.0 Are You Ready? 183 Recovering from Disaster Being Wary of Wildlife and Other Animals Disaster and life threatening situations will exacerbate the unpredictable nature of wild animals. To protect yourself and your family, learn how to deal with wildlife. Guidelines Do not approach or attempt to help an injured or stranded animal. Call your local animal control ofﬁ ce or wildlife resource ofﬁ ce. Do not corner wild animals or try to rescue them. Wild animals will likely feel threatened and may endanger themselves by dashing off into ﬂ oodwaters, ﬁ re, and so forth. Do not approach wild animals that have taken refuge in your home. Wild animals such as snakes, opossums, and raccoons often seek refuge from ﬂ oodwaters on upper levels of homes and have been known to remain after water recedes. If you encounter animals in this situation, open a window or provide another escape route and the animal will likely leave on its own. Do not attempt to capture or handle the animal. Should the animal stay, call your local animal control ofﬁ ce or wildlife resource ofﬁ ce. Do not attempt to move a dead animal. Animal carcasses can present serious health risks. Contact your local emergency management ofﬁ ce or health de- partment for help and instructions. If bitten by an animal, seek immediate medical attention. Seeking Disaster Assistance Throughout the recovery period, it is important to monitor local radio or televi- sion reports and other media sources for information about where to get emergen- cy housing, food, ﬁ rst aid, clothing, and ﬁ nancial assistance. The following section provides general information about the kinds of assistance that may be available. Recovering from Disaster 5.0 Are You Ready? 184 Direct Assistance Direct assistance to individuals and families may come from any number of organi- zations, including: American Red Cross. Salvation Army. Other volunteer organization. These organizations provide food, shelter, supplies and assist in clean-up efforts. The Federal Role In the most severe disasters, the federal government is also called in to help indi- viduals and families with temporary housing, counseling (for post-disaster trau- ma), low-interest loans and grants, and other assistance. The federal government also has programs that help small businesses and farmers. Most federal assistance becomes available when the President of the United States declares a “Major Disaster” for the affected area at the request of a state governor. FEMA will provide information through the media and community outreach about federal assistance and how to apply. Coping with Disaster The emotional toll that disaster brings can sometimes be even more devastating than the ﬁ nancial strains of damage and loss of home, business, or personal prop- erty. Understand Disaster Events Everyone who sees or experiences a disaster is affected by it in some way. It is normal to feel anxious about your own safety and that of your family and close friends. Profound sadness, grief, and anger are normal reactions to an abnormal event. Acknowledging your feelings helps you recover. Focusing on your strengths and abilities helps you heal. Accepting help from community programs and resources is healthy. Everyone has different needs and different ways of coping. It is common to want to strike back at people who have caused great pain. Children and older adults are of special concern in the aftermath of disasters. Even individuals who experience a disaster “second hand” through exposure to extensive media coverage can be affected. Contact local faith-based organizations, voluntary agencies, or professional coun- selors for counseling. Additionally, FEMA and state and local governments of the affected area may provide crisis counseling assistance.

Difﬁ culty sleeping. Difﬁ culty maintaining balance in their lives. Low threshold of frustration. Increased use of drugs/alcohol. Limited attention span. Poor work performance. Headaches/stomach problems. Tunnel vision/mufﬂ ed hearing. Colds or ﬂ u-like symptoms. Disorientation or confusion. Difﬁ culty concentrating. Reluctance to leave home. Depression, sadness. Feelings of hopelessness. Mood-swings and easy bouts of crying. Overwhelming guilt and self-doubt. Fear of crowds, strangers, or being alone. Easing Disaster-Related Stress The following are ways to ease disaster-related stress: Talk with someone about your feelings—anger, sorrow, and other emotions— even though it may be difﬁ cult. Seek help from professional counselors who deal with post-disaster stress. Do not hold yourself responsible for the disastrous event or be frustrated be- cause you feel you cannot help directly in the rescue work. Take steps to promote your own physical and emotional healing by healthy eating, rest, exercise, relaxation, and meditation. Maintain a normal family and daily routine, limiting demanding responsibili- ties on yourself and your family. Spend time with family and friends. Participate in memorials. Recovering from Disaster 5.0 Are You Ready? 186 Use existing support groups of family, friends, and religious institutions. Ensure you are ready for future events by restocking your disaster supplies kits and updating your family disaster plan. Doing these positive actions can be comforting. Helping Children Cope with Disaster Disasters can leave children feeling frightened, confused, and insecure. Whether a child has personally experienced trauma, has merely seen the event on television, or has heard it discussed by adults, it is important for parents and teachers to be informed and ready to help if reactions to stress begin to occur. Children may respond to disaster by demonstrating fears, sadness, or behavioral problems. Younger children may return to earlier behavior patterns, such as bed- wetting, sleep problems, and separation anxiety. Older children may also display anger, aggression, school problems, or withdrawal. Some children who have only indirect contact with the disaster but witness it on television may develop distress. Who is at Risk? For many children, reactions to disasters are brief and represent normal reac- tions to “abnormal events.” A smaller number of children can be at risk for more enduring psychological distress as a function of three major risk factors: Direct exposure to the disaster, such as being evacuated, observing injuries or death of others, or experiencing injury along with fearing one’s life is in danger Loss/grief: This relates to the death or serious injury of family or friends On-going stress from the secondary effects of disaster, such as temporarily living elsewhere, loss of friends and social networks, loss of personal property, parental unemployment, and costs incurred during recovery to return the family to pre-disaster life and living conditions. What Creates Vulnerabilities in Children? In most cases, depending on the risk factors above, distressing responses are temporary. In the absence of severe threat to life, injury, loss of loved ones, or secondary problems such as loss of home, moves, etc., symptoms usually dimin- ish over time. For those that were directly exposed to the disaster, reminders of the disaster such as high winds, smoke, cloudy skies, sirens, or other reminders of the disaster may cause upsetting feelings to return. Having a prior history of some type of traumatic event or severe stress may contribute to these feelings. Recovering from Disaster 5.0 Are You Ready? 187 Recovering from Disaster Children’s coping with disaster or emergencies is often tied to the way parents cope. They can detect adults’ fears and sadness. Parents and adults can make disasters less traumatic for children by taking steps to manage their own feelings and plans for coping. Parents are almost always the best source of support for children in disasters. One way to establish a sense of control and to build conﬁ - dence in children before a disaster is to engage and involve them in preparing a family disaster plan. After a disaster, children can contribute to a family recovery plan. A Child’s Reaction to Disaster by Age Below are common reactions in children after a disaster or traumatic event. Birth through 2 years. When children are pre-verbal and experience a trauma, they do not have the words to describe the event or their feelings. However, they can retain memories of particular sights, sounds, or smells. Infants may react to trauma by being irritable, crying more than usual, or wanting to be held and cuddled. The biggest inﬂ uence on children of this age is how their parents cope. As children get older, their play may involve acting out elements of the traumatic event that occurred several years in the past and was seemingly forgotten. Preschool—3 through 6 years. Preschool children often feel helpless and pow- erless in the face of an overwhelming event. Because of their age and small size, they lack the ability to protect themselves or others. As a result, they feel intense fear and insecurity about being separated from caregivers. Preschoolers cannot grasp the concept of permanent loss. They can see consequences as being revers- ible or permanent. In the weeks following a traumatic event, preschoolers’ play activities may reenact the incident or the disaster over and over again. School age—7 through 10 years. The school-age child has the ability to un- derstand the permanence of loss. Some children become intensely preoccupied with the details of a traumatic event and want to talk about it continually. This preoccupation can interfere with the child’s concentration at school and academ- ic performance may decline. At school, children may hear inaccurate informa- tion from peers. They may display a wide range of reactions—sadness, general- ized fear, or speciﬁ c fears of the disaster happening again, guilt over action or inaction during the disaster, anger that the event was not prevented, or fantasies of playing rescuer. Pre-adolescence to adolescence—11 through 18 years. As children grow older, they develop a more sophisticated understanding of the disaster event. Their responses are more similar to adults. Teenagers may become involved in dangerous, risk-taking behaviors, such as reckless driving, or alcohol or drug use. Others can become fearful of leaving home and avoid previous levels of activities. Much of adolescence is focused on moving out into the world. After a trauma, the view of the world can seem more dangerous and unsafe. A teenager may feel overwhelmed by intense emotions and yet feel unable to discuss them with others. Review See Section 1: Basic preparedness Recovering from Disaster 5.0 Are You Ready? 188 Meeting the Child’s Emotional Needs Children’s reactions are inﬂ uenced by the behavior, thoughts, and feelings of adults. Adults should encourage children and adolescents to share their thoughts and feelings about the incident. Clarify misunderstandings about risk and danger by listening to children’s concerns and answering questions. Maintain a sense of calm by validating children’s concerns and perceptions and with discus- sion of concrete plans for safety. Listen to what the child is saying. If a young child is asking questions about the event, answer them simply without the elaboration needed for an older child or adult. Some children are comforted by knowing more or less information than others; decide what level of information your particular child needs. If a child has difﬁ culty expressing feelings, allow the child to draw a picture or tell a story of what happened. Try to understand what is causing anxieties and fears. Be aware that following a disaster, children are most afraid that: The event will happen again. Someone close to them will be killed or injured. They will be left alone or separated from the family. Reassuring Children After a Disaster Suggestions to help reassure children include the following: Personal contact is reassuring. Hug and touch your children. Calmly provide factual information about the recent disaster and current plans for insuring their safety along with recovery plans. Encourage your children to talk about their feelings. Spend extra time with your children such as at bedtime. Re-establish your daily routine for work, school, play, meals, and rest. Involve your children by giving them speciﬁ c chores to help them feel they are helping to restore family and community life. Praise and recognize responsible behavior. Understand that your children will have a range of reactions to disasters. Encourage your children to help update your a family disaster plan. If you have tried to create a reassuring environment by following the steps above, but your child continues to exhibit stress, if the reactions worsen over time, or if they cause interference with daily behavior at school, at home, or with other relationships, it may be appropriate to talk to a professional. You can get profes- sional help from the child’s primary care physician, a mental health provider specializing in children’s needs, or a member of the clergy. Recovering from Disaster 5.0 Are You Ready? 189 Recovering from Disaster Monitor and Limit Your Family’s Exposure to the Media News coverage related to a disaster may elicit fear and confusion and arouse anxiety in children. This is particularly true for large-scale disasters or a terror- ist event where signiﬁ cant property damage and loss of life has occurred. Par- ticularly for younger children, repeated images of an event may cause them to believe the event is recurring over and over. If parents allow children to watch television or use the Internet where images or news about the disaster are shown, parents should be with them to encour- age communication and provide explanations. This may also include parent’s monitoring and appropriately limiting their own exposure to anxiety-provoking information. Use Support Networks Parents help their children when they take steps to understand and manage their own feelings and ways of coping. They can do this by building and using social support systems of family, friends, community organizations and agencies, faith-based institutions, or other resources that work for that family. Parents can build their own unique social support systems so that in an emergency situation or when a disaster strikes, they can be supported and helped to manage their reactions. As a result, parents will be more available to their children and better able to support them. Parents are almost always the best source of support for children in difﬁ cult times. But to support their children, parents need to attend to their own needs and have a plan for their own support. Preparing for disaster helps everyone in the family accept the fact that disasters do happen, and provides an opportunity to identify and collect the resources needed to meet basic needs after disaster. Preparation helps; when people feel prepared, they cope better and so do children. Helping Others The compassion and generosity of the American people is never more evident than after a disaster. People want to help. Here are some general guidelines on helping others after a disaster: Volunteer! Check with local organizations or listen to local news reports for information about where volunteers are needed. Note: Until volunteers are speciﬁ cally requested, stay away from disaster areas. Bring your own food, water, and emergency supplies to a disaster area if you are needed there. This is especially important in cases where a large area has been affected and emergency items are in short supply. Give a check or money order to a recognized disaster relief organization. These groups are organized to process checks, purchase what is needed, and get it to the people who need it most. Recovering from Disaster 5.0 Are You Ready? 190 Do not drop off food, clothing, or any other item to a government agency or disaster relief organization unless a particular item has been requested. Normally, these organizations do not have the resources to sort through the donated items. Donate a quantity of a given item or class of items (such as nonperishable food) rather than a mix of different items. Determine where your donation is going, how it’s going to get there, who is going to unload it, and how it is going to be distributed. Without sufﬁ cient planning, much needed supplies will be left unused. For More Information If you require more information about any of these topics, the following are resources that may be helpful.

PRA invites comments. Send those comments to the author, Doug Smith, at doug@praweb.org) Purpose This document is intended to be a bullet-point resource and reference for persons, organizations, CERT teams, and OEMs interested in developing community communications programs that use the Family Radio Service, General Mobile Radio Service, Citizens Radio Service, and Multi-Use Radio Service. The Amateur Radio Service is discussed but we refer you to your local Amateur Radio Emergency Service (ARES) and Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service (RACES) Coordinators for assistance and advice. Every OEM should proactively involve itself with the local ARES and RACES and use these groups as your PRIMARY source of supplemental communications systems and operators when normal systems collapse or are seriously over loaded. Amateur Radio operators have, for almost a century, provided emergency and disaster communication as part of their FCC licensee mandate in the Amateur FCC Rules and Regulations. Set Public Expectations People need to know what to expect after a disaster. Setting expectations is the most overlooked aspect of many service related businesses and is no less important in emergency management. It is akin to making sure both parties in an agreement thoroughly understand the mutually agreed upon terms of their contract. When people do not know what to expect they get angry, lose focus, become impatient, and then anger and pandemonium results. In the case of a disaster, panic prevails over common sense. We cannot let that happen in our communities. After a disaster CERT Volunteers and public safety agencies are focused on triage. These entities want to do the most good for the most people in the shortest amount of time. The public needs to know what to do in the first seventy-two hours after a major disaster. Likewise we CANNOT create expectations that are impossible to meet. There are efforts to declare Family Radio Service Channel one as an emergency channel. The concept is that any citizen could use a Family Radio Service radio to make a blind call for help to a monitoring Amateur radio operator after a disaster event. The proposal claims it is “instant, reliable crisis communications,” but this is far from the truth. Such a plan is unmanageable in its scope, particularly when no neighborhood familiarization or training is even suggested and in fact declared by the major proponent as unnecessary! Despite pleas from the Personal Radio Association the backers of this effort still promote this dangerous scheme. Planners need to provide the general public with some idea of the “who, what, when, where, why and how” behind the mitigation efforts for the aftermath of a disaster. Planners need to do this before the disaster and NOT after the disaster! It should be an aggressive effort of the utmost importance. One way to accomplish this is to engage the public in disaster planning at the grass-roots-neighborhood level. (CERT, neighborhood associations, Neighborhood Watch, local public meetings, REACT, building associations, parks and recreation meetings, public awareness advertising on radio and television etc.) The public must accept a level of a responsibility toward disaster preparation in order to understand their role in disaster recovery. Setting expectations means the public learns basic concepts and can keep those concepts in mind so that clear thinking prevails over panic thinking. There are not enough communications disaster workers to fulfill the needs of the Family Radio Channel One monitoring scheme. The idea completely ignores the pre-planned typical response to a major disaster in the first twenty-four to seventy-two hours. Setting the expectation that a rescuer is waiting and listening to a Family Radio might mean that some families will shelter in place after they have been asked by public safety to evacuate! Setting the wrong expectation can crate new disaster victims and new dangers for rescuers. It is an excellent idea for neighbors to create their own Family Radio Network to assist in checking up on each other after a shelter-in-place emergency. An FRS radio and back-up batteries for each family member should be part of every seventy- two-hour disaster kit. The following are some expectations to take into consideration for a communications plan using the various Personal Radio Services. 1. The Federal Communications Commission Rules and Regulations must be followed in every case. Licenses must be obtained where necessary and all users should be familiar with Part 95 of the FCC Rules as they pertain to GMRS and to the unlicensed FRS also in Part 95. The same goes for other radio services in use like Amateur Radio, FCC R&R Part 97, CB Radio Service Part 95, and the Business Radio Services in Part 90. Obeying the rules prevents anarchy, disorganization, and harmful interference. 2. Neighbors must plan to be without emergency services for up to seventy-two hours or more after a disaster. (More or less depending on the severity and scope of the event.) Every jurisdiction has a policy regarding the delivery of services after a disaster. It needs to be explained. People’s expectations must be set. 3. Emergency OES/OEM officials need to explain the expected role FRS and GMRS (Personal Radio Services) have in the event of a disaster. What it can and cannot do and what it is expected to do, how it can be used, how it should not be used. To this the OEM’s need to know what resources are available: a. Are there GMRS repeaters in your community? What the coverage areas? How many families? Where are the base stations? Are the repeaters connected to emergency power? Will the owners make the repeaters available? b. Where are the GMRS licensees in your community? Do they have base stations, repeater capable radios? Are these licensees in isolated neighborhoods? Could they be used to report for CERT back to an OEC after an emergency? Does the EOC have licensed GMRS operators to man a GMRS base station at the EOC? 4. Any use of disaster related supplemental two-way radio to relay information to public safety officials must be planned for and tested ahead of time. There must be alternate plans e.g. a Plan B. 5. Possession and use of an FRS or GMRS two-way radio does not guarantee an instant and reliable or an immediate and effective response to an individual’s call for help using that radio. NEVER set the expectation that calling out on a two-way radio will guarantee a response. Unfortunately, since this concept has already been heavily publicized some families may already believe it is a done deal. OEM’s need to reach these families before the next disaster. 6. Whenever possible, use cellular or land-line telephones instead of two-way radios. Conventional methods of communication (communication systems the public is already familiar with) should always be the preferred method of communication. It is recognized that these systems may be down or temporarily unavailable immediately after a disaster event. It is the time period immediately after the event and just before these systems are restored that very-local neighborhood two- way radio communication can be of the greatest help in mitigating welfare checks and rescues. 7. Two-way radios are primarily for neighbors to communicate with each other during and after a disaster so that CERT volunteers or others can provide immediate search and rescue or so neighbors can assist each other. 8. Two-way radio users must learn how to use their radios properly. They should know how to turn it on and off, how to change channels, disable coded squelch tones, adjust the volume, and transmit. 9. Emergency aid may not be available to some people whether or not they have a radio. They may be isolated due to impassable conditions, flooding, down power lines, fire, fallen structures, blocked roads, or there may not be public safety or other resources to assist them. 10. While it cannot be guaranteed, having a two-way radio may enable appropriate officials to communicate with persons in isolated areas. 11. Emergency management leaders, CERT trainers, and hobby radio operators need to train their neighbors in the use of two-way radios. 12. Persons should be expected to obey emergency management officials and LEAVE potential disaster areas before the event! When you are asked or ordered to leave a potential disaster area LEAVE! If you cannot leave on your own seek assistance but leave! Do not stick around expecting to use your tiny little FRS radio to call for help if you find yourself in deep water! 13. Since we generally have a very good understanding of what can occur in a natural disaster in the United States every person should plan accordingly. Offices of OES and OEM have pamphlets and websites persons can visit for disaster planning information. 14. The laws of physics as those laws relate to radio propagation of UHF radio waves apply to the eventual range of a radio in a given circumstance. The laws of sales and marketing do not apply. 15. Amateur Radio operators are NOT allowed to transmit on GMRS in an emergency with modified equipment on GMRS. (Or with Part 95 approved equipment.) Amateur Radio operators do NOT have GMRS privileges at any time. 16. The public must understand the procedures and reasons for evacuation and NOT ignore evacuation warnings. As you Begin Planning Ask these Questions 1. Who needs to talk to whom and when and for how long does that does that communication need to take place? This is going to be determined by how you deploy personnel. It may often NOT be necessary for personnel to carry radios of any kind. a. Field disaster worker to EOC b. Field disaster worker to disaster worker? c. Field disaster worker to on-scene public safety personnel. 2. How far will you need to communicate? 3. Do you need a relay by radio or telephone? 4. Who, what, where are your relay resources? 5. Is it necessary to deploy citizen volunteers with communications equipment they use or is it sufficient to relay information through on-scene public safety personnel? How many people and which people will have radios? (Not every person in a large apartment building needs a radio.) 6. Do you have alternates for your Block Captains? (Or whatever you call your very- local neighborhood emergency coordinators.) 7. What kind of interference may already exist on FRS and GMRS in my area? 8. Can the interference be mitigated? 9. What is the likelihood of intentional interference and how will interference be dealt with it if it happens? 10. Which radio channels shall we use for our neighborhood? Select based on current use. Scan the FRS and GMRS channels. Monitor activity. Choose the quietest frequencies for your area. GMRS repeater output channels may be busy with higher powered radio stations. Very-local communications should use FRS one- fourteen. 11. Are GMRS repeaters available? Where are they? Who is already using them? Can your neighborhood benefit from using the repeaters? 12. Have the licensees of those GMRS repeaters, or have other GMRS licensees been asked to join the neighborhood team? Remember GMRS repeaters are private property. While most licensees will be happy to participate as part of a local communications plan they are NOT required to do so. AT this FCC database you can search for GMRS licensees in your zip code: http://wireless2.fcc.gov/UlsApp/UlsSearch/searchGmrs.jsp 13. Does your local repeater have a tone for the neighborhood? (CTCSS/DCS) 14. How far away are we from the main roads? 15. Will our radios reach from our residences to key neighborhood access points? Have we tested our neighborhood network? 16. Can we communicate with other neighborhoods? Do we need to? 17. Is there a way to relay requests for help beyond the range of FRS? Beyond the range of GMRS? 18. Are there critical services, plants, roads, etc in the neighborhood where we should put someone with a radio? Water pumping plant, club houses, damns, beaches, guard shacks, major intersections etc. 19. Are we prepared to direct public safety resources to rescues and medical emergencies after a disaster? How can we use our radios to do this? 20. Do we have a GMRS licensee in my neighborhood? Is that licensee part of our plan? 21. Do we have an Amateur Radio operator in our neighborhood? Is that Ham part of our plan? 22. Does or OEM office know about our group? 23. Do our OEM and local public safety officials have a copy of our neighborhood communications plan? 24. Has our OEM trained us on basic emergency planning? 25. Do we have a neighborhood map and local telephone list? Is there an alerting calling-tree to alert neighbors to take cover? 26. Do we have a welfare telephone calling-tree created to check on neighbors on a priority basis! Elderly first! 27. Does our OEM have a CERT program? Do we have trained people in our neighborhood? 28. Do we have a meeting place for training? Can we arrange one? 29. Do we have meetings already scheduled so we can add this topic to the agenda? Something to think about: The Escalation of Alternative Communication Need Just as law enforcement must consider the escalation of force in the apprehension of potentially violent criminal suspects so to does the communications planner consider a supplemental communication resource escalation methodology for a disaster. 1. Whenever possible, all normal day-to-day communications systems should be used and when alternative or supplemental communications systems are in place the objective should be to return to normal systems when normal systems are restored or are adequate for the need. Normal systems are staffed by public safety, municipal, county, state or federal personnel. Assumes all landline, cellular and public safety radio systems are in place and not overwhelmed. 2. When agencies do require supplemental communication they should look first to their own public safety mutual aid plans. When those plans are insufficient use the trained volunteers of the Amateur Radio Service to free up critical public safety resources. Communication relay functions to and from an EOC/OES/OEC from disaster or other critical locations should be staffed by trained Amateur Radio Operators of the Amateur Radio Emergency Service/Radio Amateur Civil Emergency Service. 3. When there are insufficient Amateur Radio resources or there are isolated neighborhoods with no resident Amateur Radio operator consider licensing neighbors in the General Mobile Radio Service. GMRS licensees can use base or mobile stations up to fifty-watts of power and there is no license test just a simple on-line application. Supplemental very-local short-distance neighborhood communication in the same vicinity is available in the Family Radio Service. A GMRS licensee can report to an EOC on GMRS frequencies provided the EOC has a licensed GMRS operator. 4. The VHF Multi-Use Radio Service can be used for short-distance neighborhood communication and possibly for communication back to an EOC. 5. OEM’s should not overlook companies with fleets of radios in the various business radio services. Company vehicles with radios could be positioned with CERT teams and communicate back to an EOC. Assumptions about the Personal Radio Services 1. Many persons using FRS radios will have little or no prior communication training. They will have no confidence in the method or the device. Some may even refuse to own or learn to use one. 2. Radios may prove completely frustrating to some people and they will give up using them and resort to calling out for help. Planners should plan around both scenarios and NOT rely solely on two-way radios. 3. Some area residents may have read or heard about the Family Radio Channel One disaster scheme and may actually start calling out on FRS 1 after an emergency. It is unrealistic to expect that every disaster worker can carry an FRS radio but those that can or are allowed to should. This may be helpful if FRS or GMRS is used for supplemental communication in a remote area. 4. Calling out for help, if within earshot of a neighbor, makes more sense than taking the time to find one’s radio. Neighbors in no immediate peril will exit their homes safely and begin checking on others. CERT volunteers are trained to assist in situations where their safety is concerned. Some disaster victims in severely damaged structures will have to wait for professional rescuers whether they call for help out loud or using an FRS radio. 5. Some persons may have no or very limited experience with a two-way radio. Finding the push-to-talk function may be difficult for some. 6. Some users of FRS and GMRS radios will panic and cause unwanted interference trying to reach anyone they can hear. They may even unwittingly interfere with rescues in progress. Batteries could be exhausted within hours of the disaster. When these radios are used in a neighborhood the local trainers should explain wilderness protocols so that battery life is extended and the likelihood of a rescue improved as time proceeds. a. Wilderness protocol: (modified from an example used by the Amateur Radio Service. All stations (both fixed, portable or mobile) monitor Personal Radio Service frequencies every three hours. Monitoring locations that have sufficient power resources monitor for five minutes starting at the top of every hour, or continuously. b. Scan all frequencies. This increases the possibility that trapped persons who cannot properly operate a radio might be heard. 7. Some users of radios may be trapped in buildings or in other dangerous locations. It may be difficult to locate these people. Some very-local responders should be trained in simple radio direction finding techniques to approximate the location of trapped radio users. (Body fading.) Local Amateur Radio Service volunteers and Squadrons of the Civil Air Patrol have expertise in radio direction finding. 8. CTCSS and DCS settings will prevent communication and cause severe confusion. The public should be taught to use radios with these squelch codes disabled. 9. Individuals with criminal intent may attempt to take advantage of persons in distress, or fake distress calls in order to identify the location of law enforcement or search and rescue resources or unprotected properties to coordinate looting. 10. The lack of training and sophistication of users requires extraordinary personal communication and negotiation abilities of persons carrying radios and responding to victims. Some pre-disaster communications training is required. 11. CB may be useless or of very limited range. Most CB’s will be in cars. There will be a few base stations. Communication during periods of active shortwave skip may be limited depending on local terrain. 12. MURS users will be scarce. 13. Many families will already own an FRS or a GMRS bubble-pack radio. Not everyone in the family will know how to use them. In most cases batteries will be dead or will soon be dead since most radios cannot be recharged in a vehicle. 14. Some two-way radio users will not cooperate with neighborhood groups and will do as they please. Some may even cause deliberate interference. 15. Some smaller groups will organize and use FRS and GMRS radios without being part of a larger plan. OEM officials will eventually learn about these groups and have difficulty verifying their authenticity. Some may lay claim to specific radio frequencies as their own. (Licensing encourages people to follow rules that prevent mutual interference.) 16. Local business radio users are going to be using their own business radio channels. OES OEM should coordinate with companies that have large fleets to take advantage of business repeaters and high powered simplex radios. Planning Participants using GMRS should license in GMRS. Planning should include local GMRS licensees. There should be an effort to license families in GMRS in America’s neighborhoods that want to help each other during or immediately after an emergency using two-way radios. Encourage local jurisdictions to have an FRS GMRS communications plan within the existing FCC Rules governing both services. These jurisdictions should locate and negotiate with all GMRS resources. GMRS based organizations can create a committee to explore the appropriate use of the FRS in an emergency for their area and make recommendations to OES/OEMs. GMRS groups should support community based disaster communication plans and work within those plans to provide public emergency communications. GMRS repeater owners should invite new families onto their systems so families get used to operating GMRS radio systems. The public needs informative packets, and training information. No disaster program will work without training. This includes extremely basic radio operation instructions, storage of spare batteries, and disaster related supplies. Such training should be provided through local offices of emergency management or groups with CERT affiliations, Neighborhood Watch, community associations etc. Set the public expectation of FRS channel one as an emergency radio frequency to summon assistance on demand. Remember, OEM’s warn persons in areas anticipating weather related emergencies that public safety cannot respond to telephone calls immediately after a disaster. Calling for help or rescue on a Family Radio Service portable radio does not increase your chances of emergency assistance. In a local plan make use of radio frequencies after surveying your areas normal activity. Create a primary and backup channel. Do not put simplex radio traffic on a local repeater output. Know your neighbors ahead of time. Get to know folks on a first and last name basis before the disaster strikes. Have designated alternates for important tasks. Every family should have a communications plan for a disaster. This includes a telephone contact plan, family-expectation setting regarding future welfare related telephone calls. Every family should have one designated contact person far from the emergency (another city or state) that can be a single point of contact for all family members. Disaster communications planners, while taking into consideration the limitations of GMRS and FRS should: a. Share with neighborhoods the benefits of communicating after an emergency to assess the welfare of persons by radio in a very local way. b. The need for a neighbor or neighbors to learn how to effectively use a two-way radio during and immediately after a disaster. c. Encourage neighbors to use radios with coded-squelch disabled. d. Develop local ways for neighborhoods to communicate with OES/OEM officials. Suggestions 1. A neighborhood should standardize on a particular make and model of FRS radio (if possible) for those people that have no prior experience using radios and that might be likely to have problems using their radios. 2. Pick a radio that uses regular alkaline batteries you can replace. When electricity is out you may not be able to recharge your rechargeable batteries. 3. Some simple method of wearing the radio on the belt, around the neck, or clipped to clothing should be devised so it is not lost. (Especially for the elderly and the sick.) 4. Use of call tones should be discouraged. These tones serve no useful purpose. They make the radio an obnoxious toy. 5. A neighborhood communications volunteer should set up FRS radios for those that cannot do it properly themselves. 6. Neighborhoods should have Block Captains. Block Captains have the responsibility to call everyone on the radio during and after a disaster to verify the welfare of people in the homes and buildings around them. 7. Large buildings should have designated Floor Captains and alternates that carry radios. Every building should have a communications plan in place with their evacuation plan. It is not realistic that every employee should carry an FRS radio in a business structure but key employees that are part of the neighborhood disaster plan should do so. 8. A neighborhood’s radio system should be tested at least four times a year. A good time may be just prior to a Neighborhood Watch meeting or local disaster preparedness meeting. Neighbors should use their radios informally all year so they become familiar with the radio. 9. As many volunteers as can be found should take CERT training so everyone responding to calls from help can so do with some confidence and without injury. 10. CERT teams should not have to design or re-design communications systems or methods already included in their local disaster plans. CERT emphasis is on rescue and public welfare. Disaster planners should do this work for CERT volunteers. 11. Neighbors who want to license in the GMRS should pay the license fee, and buy a base station and mobile radio capable of attaching to an external antenna. These neighbors can be a link to a designated resource up the communications chain. 12. Amateur Radio operators in the neighborhood should be identified and included in neighborhood communications planning. Amateurs can serve as a neighborhood’s link back to the designated public safety agency. Areas with great distances between neighborhoods can benefit from such a scheme. 13. A neighborhood should be included in a multi-hazard functional plan for the jurisdiction in which it is located. Contact persons, and their addresses and phone numbers should be kept up to date for every local neighborhood. This is easier to do through Neighborhood Watch or Neighborhood Association meetings since these are regularly conducted by local police jurisdictions. 14. When using a radio to talk to a neighbor use plain language. Do not use ten codes. 15. Use radio codes instead of plain language only if you can guarantee there will be no misunderstandings. 16. Maritime communities should think about communicating with each other on GMRS and FRS. VHF maritime channels cannot be legally used on land. The maritime channels may be busy with maritime distress activities. 17. Teach everyone who owns a radio how to use the radio with specific emphasis on: a. Listening before transmitting b. Disabling CTCSS and DCS c. Disabling scrambling d. Speaking in plain language. e. Directing all communications to a specific person or unit. f. Responding only to known persons. g. How to make a general call to anyone that can hear you only when you cannot reach designated persons. h. Having enough batteries on hand to use your radio continuously for at least seventy-two hours. i. Keeping your radio and batteries within easy to reach, away from areas that might be damaged during earthquakes or storms. j. In advance warning of an emergency putting your radio on your belt or clipping it to your clothing. k. Putting packs of extra batteries in your pocket in case you are not able to get back to your supply in the event of a building collapse. l. In advance of a disaster warning, attempt to contact other members of your neighborhood group and check in with Block Captains. Block Captains should have paper and pencil to record names and addresses of check-ins. It is also good to know who has already evacuated. m. Have a current neighborhood map with address numbers, telephone numbers, and names of families recorded on the map. n. After a disaster Block Captains should contact every person that checked in and attempt to contact those that did not. o. Block Captains should allow persons in actual distress to check in before those that are not. Everyone needs to know they are helped by neighborhood resources on a priority basis! p. Persons in distress should begin transmitting the moment they determine their vocal cries for help are not being heard. Transmit and listen, transmit and listen. “This is Bill on Main St. Please help me.” Stop transmitting when you are called or are asked to do so. Indicate you are injured when you are called. State your name, last known location (where you should be), and the nature of your emergency. (follow a suggested wilderness protocol like that mentioned in this document) q. Signaling in the event you cannot speak. Radios require speech, but you can create a method of signaling, or responding to yes and no questions if you can tap or rub the radio against a solid object while transmitting. Whatever system you develop should be widely understood among the neighbors and only used as a last resort. Be prepared to answer once for yes two for no. r. Preventing an open-microphone condition and what to do if one happens e.g. switching to an alternate channel. OES/OEM’s, Public Safety - Make a Commitment Now There are some considerations in this list that are frankly, a little outside the scope of FRS and GMRS but these should be considered so that FRS and GMRS use can be considered in context by disaster planners. OES/OEM’s that plan for supplemental communication functions need to encourage and train volunteers through drills and organized training. Volunteers need encouragement, recognition, drills, training etc. Determine the supplemental communications needs of every neighborhood, public safety agency, major utility etc and work your volunteers into those places. Amateur Radio RACES and ARES should be your primary supplemental civilian communications resource. In the case of Amateur Radio volunteers, Public Safety agencies, particularly police, have an obligation to use Amateurs as RACES volunteers and not ARES volunteers. This does not mean the local Ham population has to be Balkanized! This just means that Hams assigned to work a specific agency are volunteers at that agency as well as members of the local ARES. They wear two hats. Public Safety agencies often fingerprint RACES volunteers. This allows agencies to assert some control over the quality and integrity of volunteers that serve. In most cases it also qualifies volunteers to receive workman’s compensation insurance benefits if injured in the line of duty. Actively train and provide drills for volunteers. Avoid using your communications volunteers in other roles. It makes sense to train communications volunteers so that they understand the concepts behind the disaster mitigation effort. Their expertise is however communications. After a disaster, that expertise is valuable and in some cases they may prove more valuable as a communicator than as neighborhood search and rescue volunteer. Encourage firefighters, Dispatch, OES/OEM, medical personnel, and police officers to become Amateur Radio operators. These folks are often highly motivated leaders of volunteers. They understand how to get things done in government and planners tend to take them seriously. Volunteers feel honored to serve alongside their very qualified partners. It can truly make a difference in training, and effectiveness to have 911 staff, police staff, and even firefighters become Amateur radio operators. By making a commitment you are more likely to identify those volunteers that should not be part of a program before an emergency occurs. You can also work with local volunteer groups to create other useful jobs for volunteers. When you set standards and set expectations for volunteers you will have a better program. Setting up a grass-roots neighborhood supplemental communications plan is difficult. The reason is that the people doing the communicating are not necessarily radio or communications enthusiasts. Their primary interest is the safety of family and neighbors. (CERT) Whatever you decide to set up should not diminish the primary role of the CERT volunteer. An OES/OEM may not have the resources to train communicators but your local Amateur/GMRS population does! It is what they already do. They can serve you well in this function. Trainers that are currently or former public safety employees make excellent trainers. Work hard to develop a trainer’s skills and help them write a training program with which your agency is comfortable. Avoid competing communications volunteer programs. Political jurisdictions should make this a requirement for OES/OEM’s and all volunteer groups. There is no room for griping, finger pointing, politics, or empire building in communications disaster planning. That message must be conveyed to volunteers. Plans should not be Balkanized among or across clubs or special interest groups. CERT volunteers needing communications should not be in the position of having to set up their own communications methodologies without appropriate leadership. You do not want these groups re-inventing the wheel. Involve RACES volunteers and GMRS licensees as communicators for CERT teams. When you find it difficult to recruit communications volunteers work harder at it. Ask people why they no longer bother to volunteer and you may be surprised. It is not necessarily their age or lack of interest. On the contrary, it is often that when volunteers do express an interest in serving the various jurisdictions do not take the volunteers seriously. Amateur Radio Operators have often been in the position, despite an incredible record of service, of having to sell their capabilities and themselves to political jurisdictions over and over again because the jurisdictions do not take the Amateurs seriously. The same goes for GMRS groups. Do not wait for them to come to you, go to them. Over and over again Amateurs have proven their value perhaps just not you – not yet anyway. Make sure your OES/OEM leaders are the right people. It is not a desk job. It’s a people job, an organizers job, a political job, a leadership job, and a tough job. The skills required are supervisory, managerial, organizational, and political. There is a strong emphasis on the ability to manage resources and supervise various types and levels of volunteer resources. The diversity of America’s neighborhoods makes an approach to a supplemental communications or CERT program different on many levels. How you make it work and what you do with it is going to depend on very-local circumstances. A CERT approach in a farming community is going to necessarily be different than a CERT approach in an inner city apartment building. When you create very-local communications plans decide first what it is you want these communicators to do. Is communicating their job or is communication necessary to get their real job done? These are two very different things. An Amateur Radio operator trains to provide supplemental communications and it is his or her job. A CERT neighbor trains to rescue an elderly neighbor from the debris of a collapsed building and he/she needs to communicate status and requests for additional resources while getting their real work done. This is also one major reason why you do not want a CERT leader to have to reinvent communications plans! Assign a communicator to find and train your CERT in the appropriate radio service that can provide tactical communication after an emergency. The communicator then trains the trainers who train the neighbors. Training is easier than you think. Start train-the-trainer programs for neighborhood volunteers. Standardize training. Use handouts, Power Point, lectures, and demonstrations. Train people not only how to do something but also discuss why it is so important. Discuss the potential consequences for plan failures due to modified personal interpretations and implementations. OEM’s and communications trainers should identify loose canons – people with scary security guard mentalities, or personality problems that can make them a liability and not an asset. Neighborhoods can find something for these folks to do but they should not be responsible for the success of a program if they are not likely to follow rules, guidelines, laws, or policies. It is OK to set standards and ask neighborhood volunteers to accept those standards. Develop volunteer agreements that contain a span of control, and a scope of work and a defined chain of command within your Incident Command System. Standards of behavior and the organization of the volunteer service need to be clearly understood. Volunteers must be required to sign a document indicating their understanding of policies and procedures. It is highly recommended that any disaster communications volunteer having official access to restricted areas be trained as CERT volunteers are in the local Incident Command System and that they be fingerprinted and at a minimum those fingerprints are checked through your state’s Department of Justice (CORI) or equivalent using procedures in place for public safety applicants. Volunteers with criminal records should be excused from service. A Quick Look at the Personal Radio Services Citizens Radio Service The service was originally created to provide the public with a simple, low-cost radio service on which to conduct personal business or commerce. CB was created in the high-end of the short-wave radio spectrum. It is the old Amateur Radio Services eleven meter band. Short-wave radio signals propagate over great distances. Low power CB radio can be heard around the world. Every eleven years the sunspot cycle causes reliable world-wide propagation. The first CB rules and those of today forbid operators from talking to others that are over one-hundred fifty miles away. When average citizens discovered they could talk great distances like Amateur Radio operators they began using CB illegally to “shoot skip.” CB was rendered a useless wasteland by these outlaw hobbyists. The problem of illegal CB use became so great that the FCC abandoned licensing of CB stations. The FCC even abandoned enforcement to a great extent by asking Congress to allow local jurisdictions to investigate complaints of illegal power amplifiers. The FCC does still occasionally locate and fine illegal operators but their emphasis has now been placed on enforcement activities directed at retailers of illegal CB radio equipment. There is now complete anarchy on CB. Illegal hobbyists have had control of the band for decades. Illegal CB operations were the impetuous behind extraordinarily restrictive covenants, codes, and restrictions against radio operation in homes and neighborhoods. In some areas of the country housing discrimination is reportedly being practiced against licensed radio hobbyists – including Amateur Radio Operators. The use of illegal CB power amplifiers is still a problem throughout the United States. There are very few home CB base stations now. CB is widely used by the trucking industry so drivers can communicate with each other on the highways and in some cases their delivery depots. CB hobby communication is frequently profane, off-color, and juvenile. Most would say it is not a radio service they would want their children to listen to. CB is still used by some Americans in cars, by four-wheel-drive enthusiasts, in boats, and RV’s. The useful distance of a CB radio is greatly reduced during periods of short-wave band openings due to illegal hobby operations. Very-local distance expectations between mobile units can be from less than one mile to tens of miles. The CB clubs of the past died out with the popularity of CB. Four-wheel drive clubs often have CB radios in all member vehicles. These clubs could be an excellent communications and transportation resource. They have their own communication and provide vehicles that can go where many cannot. CB walkie-talkie’s have very limited range because of low-profile and very inefficient antennas. CB might be a useful way for neighbors in rural areas to talk to each other if they live within a few miles. Local CB communication may be better at night when, in most cases, hobby operations cease as signal propagation decreases. CB should not be considered a highly reliable communications resource. Wherever you plan to use it, test it first. Insist that all use of radios be legal. Never allow illegal linear amplifiers to be used by volunteers. Planners should question the integrity of any volunteer breaking FCC Rules. There are legitimate users of CB that do use their radios for family communication. The PRA believes that encouraging such use may eventually have an effect of the usefulness of the radio service. Multi-Use Radio Service The Multi-Use Radio Service consists of five VHF radio frequencies. Operation on these frequencies does not require an FCC license; however, unlicensed operation does require that transceivers meet very specific FCC MURS requirements. Transceivers that do not meet MURS requirements may not be used without an FCC license. There are still licensed businesses sharing these radio channels. Some major radio manufacturers were not pleased with the FCC’s decision to create the MURS service and for this reason have stubbornly refused to make equipment for it. Because of this, MURS radios are not as easy to find or purchase as one might think. VHF radio waves propagate better through forested areas. Two watts on VHF may go considerably farther than two watts on UHF GMRS. Businesses and unscrupulous radio dealers put customers on these five frequencies and deliberately failed to license. The widespread abuse of the licensing requirement prompted the FCC to license-by-rule just as the FCC did with the CB band. Low-power VHF generally does not propagate like short-wave radio. Interference is likely to come from existing business users and unlicensed business users. Interference is more likely in urban areas. These frequencies are often used as drive-up window channels at restaurants and as portable-to-portable business radios in stores, warehouses, malls, construction sites, and as itinerant devices. Users of this radio service are required to share the frequencies they use. MURS would be an acceptable very-local communications option for a neighborhood, particular where forests and rolling hills are plentiful. Family Radio Service The FRS is a license-free very-short-range radio service. FRS channels one through seven are shared with the General Mobile Radio Service. GMRS licensees may have small base stations up to five watts effective radiated power on FRS one through seven. This rule can make FRS in a neighborhood useful if one licensed resident can communicate well with many local hand-held FRS radios. FRS channels eight through fourteen are exclusive to the FRS. Families and businesses are both allowed to use radios that are FCC approved for the Family Radio Service. Anarchy reigns on the FRS in urban areas. Interference can be severe. FRS radio waves travel line of sight. Antenna height is more important to range than is the power of the radio. Communication over tens of miles is possible from high altitudes. Heavily forested areas limit the range of FRS. UHF radio waves are absorbed by vegetation. Intentional interference on FRS is common. Call tones are typically used to interfere and annoy others. Very-local use of FRS around a neighborhood or a home is very effective. FRS radios are limited to one-half watt output. Only the United States and Canada share a Family Radio Service on the same frequencies. Use of FRS radios in other countries is illegal. Some persons have obtained prior permission to use FRS frequencies in other countries but this is the exception and not the rule. Manufacturer marketing claims of useful communication beyond several hundred feet to one half mile are greatly exaggerated and intended only to sell radios by creating unrealistic expectations in the minds of consumers. Children should not use FRS radios unsupervised. Parents should know who their children are talking to especially with the new Hasbro text-messaging radios. FRS radios are unfortunately also used by criminals. Use of FRS radios as children’s toys should be discouraged. Use of FRS radios and other two-way radios by hunters to coordinate the hunting of game may be regulated in some states. In some states it is considered unsportsmanlike conduct to coordinate the hunt using two-way radios. FRS radios are perfect for neighbors to use to keep in touch before, during, and after disasters. FCC rules prohibit FRS radio connection to external antennas. FCC rules prohibit FRS radio connection to telephone systems. FCC rules prohibit FRS radio connection to store and forward repeaters. General Mobile Radio Service Use of GMRS is limited to personal licensees. Organizations, clubs, and businesses are not eligible to license in GMRS. Individuals are licensed upon application and payment of a license fee. The renewable license is good for five years. Personal licensees may conduct their personal business. A person’s GMRS license covers their immediate family members including members of the immediate family not living in the licensee’s home. A licensee is responsible for the proper operation of all radio equipment used as part of the licensee’s system. GMRS base stations and mobile units may use external antennas and power outputs up to fifty watts. GMRS licensees may use up to five watts effective radiated power on GMRS interstitial channels also known as Family Radio Service channels one through seven. GMRS allows the use of radio repeater stations. Higher power outputs of GMRS radios make communications more reliable over greater distances. GMRS repeaters are considered private property. Repeaters may be shared by licensees but sharing agreements must be in writing and kept with station records. Methods of Communication for Very-local Communication (Under development) The following suggestions are for very-local neighborhood groups. Your implementation may vary depending upon colloquial circumstances. This is not a one-size fits all approach. The planner wants to choose simple-language communication methods rather than try to teach ten-codes or other similar codes used by public safety communicators. The general public speaks in words so stick with plain language call signs also called tactical identifiers. Minimize future confusion by encouraging neighbors to use their radios for family use and events around the neighborhood. Make FRS radios and perhaps even GMRS a tool of your local Neighborhood Watch. Mistakes to Avoid CERT organizations have no right under law to issue GMRS radios to unlicensed volunteers. There is a trend developing of jurisdictions purchasing the twenty-two channel bubble-pack GMRS radios and issuing these radios to volunteers. The uniformed believe these are FRS radios. Jurisdictions tell volunteers to use the channels that do not require a license and to avoid using the higher power GMRS channels unless told to do so. Some jurisdictions even make up their own rules to say when volunteers can use GMRS channels without license authority. This is inconsistent with the license requirements for these radios and is against FCC Rules. It is not good planning. Do not make this mistake or you will run afoul of the law. Read the GMRS Rules in FCC R&R Part 95. Observe the license requirements for radios certified as GMRS radios. Do not make the assumption that you have the right to do as you please with a GMRS radio because you represent a police, fire, or OEM agency. The Federal Communications Commission makes the rules and enforces the rules. You may not interpret the rules for your own benefit. Amateur Radio operators, public safety jurisdictions, nor OES/OEM’s should assume that they have the right to use GMRS radios without a license or to issue GMRS radios to non Hams in order to outfit citizen ACS teams. (Auxiliary Communications Service teams.) Assume that your illegal operations on GMRS will be noticed. Do not break the law. There is an ever growing membership of the Personal Radio Association taking responsibility for monitoring GMRS nationwide. Unlicensed operation is reported to the Federal Communications Commission. You could find you or your agency having to explain to the FCC why you have ignored and operated outside of the FCC Rules. Do not permit Amateur Radio operators assisting as communications volunteers to use modified Amateur Radio equipment on GMRS frequencies. This is not allowed under FCC Rules. Permitting your volunteers to break the law is not the right thing to do. Local ARES/RACES leaders should certify that all Amateur Radio communications disaster service volunteers do not operate with modified equipment. Do not permit public safety employees to program GMRS channels in public safety radios or to use modified Amateur Radios on public safety frequencies. Do not assume that your organization has the right to commandeer a GMRS or FRS channel for your exclusive use. Opportunities for Manufacturers Manufacturers have gone about the development and marketing of FRS radios in all the wrong ways. Development is entirely about what the marketing manager expects will tempt the average citizen to buy the product without regard to licensing. The marketers want the radios loaded with features. They insist on making bizarre claims as to the range radios will transmit effectively. It is all about what a marketing manager believes will sell the product and not at all about how useful the radio actually is. The most glaring examples are the intentional built-in complexities of these radios that should be so incredibly simple. Set-up menus and multiple controls confuse and bemuse the average citizen making the radios almost impossible to use. One excellent argument against the use of today’s FRS/GMRS bubble-pack radios for use in emergency situations was put this way: “Take any two FRS (or bubble-pack GMRS) radios from competing manufacturers and set each radio on a different channel with different call tones. Hand the radios to an average person with an instruction book and ask them to set the radios up so they can talk to each other.” One or both people will certainly give up and setting up a radio to communicate during an emergency is too late! Manufacturers have an opportunity to reverse confusion by developing FRS only radios for use in neighborhoods as radios for crime prevention teams or CERT with the following features: 1. FRS only channels so radios can be used license free. 2. Elimination of the tone-coded squelch option. a. Eliminates complicated set up b. Eliminates problems associated with model differences between manufacturers c. Eliminates interference to GMRS repeaters when operated on FRS eight through fourteen. d. Enables persons to quickly and easily talk to each other. 3. Elimination of the call tone feature. This feature has rarely served a useful purpose. It is most frequently used to interfere with and to annoy others. It makes the radio a toy. 4. Simple one-button scan function. Why make the changes? CTCSS and DCS tones are difficult to set up in most radios. Manufacturers market CTCSS and DCS tones as privacy feature when it is anything but a privacy feature. Most people with CTCSS or DCS enabled will never listen first before transmitting and often interfere with others. An FRS radio with CTCSS or DCS enabled will prevent communication with others. Menu and push-button function set up methods are confusing and difficult to master. Feature rich radios are communication poor. Reduced complexity emphasizes voice communication. An FRS-only radio is license free. Something that that has escaped the attention of manufacturers and marketing managers for a number of years. Most serious GMRS licensees invest in high quality commercial-grade two-way radio equipment and have invested a great deal of money in this equipment. Commercial-grade radios last longer, are more reliable, and in many cases much simpler to use. These radios may be of similar quality and manufacture as radios in use by public safety agencies. Marine Radio The 156-160 MHz marine band is intended for use on the water. It is illegal to use a land based marine radio transceiver unless the station is licensed as a coast station by the FCC. Obtaining a coast station license is not easy. Only businesses and public safety agencies having a need to communicate with vessels on the water is even eligible. Activities of the Coast Guard are also covered in Federal regulations. Citizens on board boats under a certain length and weight are allowed to use mobile marine radio without a license. The average citizen may not operate a land based marine coast station or even a marine portable radio while on land. --- Content from Copy of Disaster Supplies Checklists --- 195 Appendix B Are You Ready? 195 Appendix B: Disaster Supplies Checklists The following list is to help you determine what to include in your disaster sup- plies kit that will meet your family’s needs.

After a disaster, local officials and relief workers will be on the scene, but they cannot reach everyone immediately. You could get help in hours, or it may take days. Basic services, such as electricity, gas, water, and tele- phones, may be cut off, or you may have to evacuate at a moment’s notice. You probably won’t have time to shop or search for the supplies you’ll need. Your family will cope best by preparing for disaster before it strikes. What is a Disaster Supplies Kit? Assembling the supplies you might need following a disaster is an impor- tant part of your Family Disaster Plan. Following a disaster, having extra sup- plies at home or supplies to take with you in the event of an evacuation can help your family endure evacuation or home confinement. Learn more about Disaster Supplies Kits by contact- ing your local emergency management agency or American Red Cross chapter. Awareness Information Involve children in disaster preparedness. Ask children to help you remember to keep your kits in working order by changing the food and water every six months and replacing batteries as necessary. Children might make calendars or posters with the appropriate dates marked on them. Ask children to think of items that they would like to include in their own Disaster Supplies Kit, such as books or games or appropriate nonperishable food items.

Produced by the National Disaster Education Coalition: American Red Cross, FEMA, IAEM, IBHS, NFPA, NWS, USDA/ CSREES, and USGS Disaster Supplies Kit 20 Prepare Your Kit Tips for Your Disaster Supplies Kit Keep a smaller Disaster Supplies Kit in the trunk of each car. If you become stranded or are not able to return home, having some items will help you to be more comfortable until help arrives. Keep items in airtight plastic bags. This will help protect them from damage or spoiling. Replace stored food and water every six months. Replacing your food and water supplies will help ensure their freshness. Rethink your kit and family needs at least once a year. Replace batteries, update clothes, etc. Ask your physician or pharmacist about storing prescription medications. It may be difficult to obtain prescription medications dur- ing a disaster because stores may be closed or supplies may be limited. Use an easy-to-carry container for the supplies you would most likely need for an evacuation. Label it clearly. Possible containers include: I A large, covered trash container. I A camping backpack. I A duffel bag. I A cargo container that will fit on the roof of your vehicle. Disaster Supplies Kit Basics The following items might be needed at home or for an evacuation. Keeping them in an easy-to-carry backpack or duffel bag near your door would be best in case you need to evacuate quickly, such as in a tsunami, flash flood, or major chemical emergency. Store your kit in a convenient place known to all family members. Kit basics are: A portable, battery-powered radio or television and extra batteries. Flashlight and extra batteries. First aid kit and first aid manual. Supply of prescription medications. Credit card and cash. Personal identification. An extra set of car keys. Matches in a waterproof container. Signal flare. Map of the area and phone numbers of places you could go. Special needs, for example, diapers or formula, prescription medicines and copies of prescriptions, hearing aid batteries, spare wheelchair battery, spare eyeglasses, or other physical needs. If you have additional space, consider adding some of the items from your Evacuation Supplies Kit. Evacuation Supplies Kit Place in an easy-to-carry container the supplies you would most likely need if you were to be away from home for several days. Label the container clearly. Remember to include: Disaster Supplies Kit basics (listed above). Three gallons of water per person. Three-day supply of nonperishable food. Kitchen accessories: manual can opener; mess kits or paper cups, plates, and plastic/disposable utensils; utility knife; a can of cooking fuel if food must be cooked; household liquid bleach to treat drinking water; sugar, salt, pepper; aluminum foil; plastic resealable bags. One complete change of clothing and footwear for each family member, sturdy shoes or workboots, raingear, hat and gloves, thermal under- wear, sunglasses. Blankets or sleeping bag for each family member. Tools and other accessories: paper, pencil; needles and thread; pliers, shut-off wrench, shovels, and other useful tools; tape; medicine dropper; whistle; plastic sheeting; small canister, A-B-C-type fire extinguisher; emergency preparedness manual; tube tent; compass. Sanitation and hygiene items: toilet paper, tow- elettes; soap, hand sanitizer, liquid detergent; femi- nine supplies; personal items such as shampoo, deodorant, toothpaste, toothbrushes, comb and brush, lip balm; plastic garbage bags (heavy-duty) and ties (for personal sanitation uses); medium- sized plastic bucket with tight lid; disinfectant; household chlorine bleach; small shovel for digging an expedient latrine. Entertainment, such as games and books. Remember to consider the needs of very young and older family members, such as Talking About Disaster: Guide for Standard Messages 21 To Build a Makeshift Toilet Line a bucket with a garbage bag and make a toilet seat out of two boards placed parallel to each other across the bucket. After each use, pour a disinfec- tant such as bleach (1 part liquid chlorine bleach to 10 parts water) into the garbage bag. This will help avoid infection and stop the spread of disease. Cover the bucket tightly when it is not in use. Bury garbage and human waste to avoid the spread of disease by rats and insects. Dig a pit two to three feet deep and at least 50 feet downhill or away from any well, spring, or water supply. Disaster Supplies Kit 22 infants and elderly or disabled persons. I For baby: formula, diapers, bottles, powdered milk, medications. I For adults: heart and high blood pressure medication, insulin, pre- scription drugs, denture needs, contact lenses and supplies, extra eyeglasses, and hearing aid batteries. Home Disaster Supplies Kit In addition to your Disaster Supplies Kit basics and Evacuation Supplies Kit, gathering the following items will help your family endure home confine- ment, which often happens following disasters and may include the loss of utilities. Wrench to turn off household gas and water. Keep it near the shut-off valves. A week’s supply of food and water. Additional blankets and sleeping bags. Also, consider using a NOAA Weather Radio with the tone-alert feature in your home. NOAA Weather Radio is the best means for receiving warn- ings from the National Weather Service. The National Weather Service con- tinuously broadcasts updated weather warnings and forecasts that can be received by NOAA Weather Radios sold in many stores. NOAA Weather Radio now broadcasts warning and postevent information for all types of hazards — both natural (such as earthquakes and volcanic activity) and technological (such as chemical releases or oil spills). Working with other federal agencies and the Federal Communications Commission’s new Emergency Alert System, NOAA Weather Radio is an “all hazards” radio network, making it the single source for the most comprehensive weather and emergency information available to the public. Your National Weather Service recommends purchasing a radio that has both a battery backup and a Specific Area Message Encoder (SAME) feature, which automatically alerts you when a watch or warning is issued for your county, giving you immediate information about a life-threatening situation. The average range is 40 miles, depending on topography; the National Weather Radio signal is a line-of-sight signal, which does not bore through hills or mountains. Water Having an ample supply of clean water is a top priority in an emergency. Store water in plastic containers, such as soft drink plastic bot- tles. Seal containers tightly, label them and store in a cool, dark place. Replace water every six months. Avoid using containers that will decompose or break, such as milk cartons or glass bottles. Keep at least a three-day supply of water, or a minimum of three gallons per person. It is strongly recommended to have more if possible. Use one-half gallon per day for drinking, and one-half gallon for cooking and sanitation. A normally active person needs to drink at least two quarts of water each day. Hot environments and intense phys- ical activity can double that amount. Children, nursing mothers, and ill people will need more. Store your three-day supply in a handy place. You need to have water packed and ready in case there is no time to fill water bottles when disaster strikes. Water needs to be treated only if it is of questionable purity. I Boiling is the safest method of treating water. Strain water through a clean cloth to remove bulk impurities. Bring water to a rolling boil for about one full minute, keeping in mind that some water will evaporate. Let the water cool before drinking. Boiled water will taste better if you put oxygen back into it by pouring the water back and forth between two clean containers. This will also improve the taste of stored water. I You can use household liquid bleach to kill microorganisms. Use only regular household liquid bleach that contains 5.25 percent sodi- um hypochlorite. Do not use scented bleaches, color-safe bleaches, or bleaches with added cleaners. Add 16 drops of bleach per gallon of water, stir, and let stand for 30 minutes. If the water does not have a slight bleach odor, repeat the dosage and let stand another 15 minutes. If it still does not smell of chlorine, discard it and find another source of water. Other chemicals, such as iodine or water treatment products sold in camping or surplus stores that do not contain 5.25 percent hypochlorite as the only active ingredient, are not recommended and should not be used. I Distillation involves boiling water and then collecting the vapor that condenses back to water. The condensed vapor will not include salt or other solid impurities. To distill, fill a pot halfway with water. Tie a cup to the handle on the pot’s lid so that the cup will hang rightside up when the lid is upside down (make sure the cup is not touching the water) and boil the water for 20 minutes. The water that drips from the lid into the cup is distilled. Melt ice cubes or use water from undamaged hot water tanks, toilet tanks (not the bowl), and water pipes if you need addition- al water. If you need to find water outside of your home, you can use rainwater; streams, rivers, and other moving bodies of water; ponds and lakes; and natural springs. If you question its purity, Talking About Disaster: Guide for Standard Messages 23 Disaster Supplies Kit 24 be sure to treat the water first. Avoid water with floating material, an odor, or a dark color. Use saltwater only if you distill it first. Do NOT drink flood water. Food Even though it is unlikely that an emergency would cut off your food supply for two weeks, you should consider preparing a supply that will last that long. The easiest way to develop a two-week stockpile is to increase the amount of basic foods you normally keep on your shelves. If your water supply is limited, try to avoid foods that are high in fat and protein, and don’t stock salty foods, since they will make you thirsty. Familiar foods can lift morale and give a feeling of security in time of stress. Also, canned foods won’t require cooking, water, or special preparation. Take into account your family’s unique needs and tastes. Try to include foods that they will enjoy and that are also high in calories, protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Pack at least a three-day supply of nonperishable food and water, and store it in a handy place. You need to have these items packed and ready in case there is no time to gather food from the kitchen when disaster strikes. Select foods that require no refrigeration, preparation, or cooking, and little or no water. Foods that are compact and lightweight are easy to store and carry. If you must heat food, pack a can of cooking fuel. Try to eat salt-free crackers, whole grain cereals, and canned food with high liquid content. Recommended foods include: I Ready-to-eat canned meats, fruits, and vegetables. I Canned juice, milk, and soup (if powdered, store extra water). I High-energy foods, such as peanut butter, jelly, crackers, granola bars, and trail mix. I Comfort foods, such as hard candy, sweetened cereals, candy bars, and cookies. I Instant coffee, tea bags. I Foods for infants, elderly persons, or persons on special diets, if necessary. Also consider: I Compressed food bars. They store well, are lightweight, taste good, and are nutritious. I Trail mix. Available prepackaged, or assemble your own. I Dried foods. They can be nutritious and satisfying, but contain a lot of salt, which promotes thirst. I Freeze-dried foods. They are tasty and lightweight, but will need water for reconstitution. I Instant meals. Cups of noodles or cups of soup are a good addition, although they need water for reconstitution. I Snack-sized canned goods. Good because they generally have pull-top lids or twist-open keys. I Prepackaged beverages. Those in foil packets and foil-lined boxes are suitable because they are tightly sealed and will keep for a long time. Food options to avoid: I Commercially dehydrated foods. They can require a great deal of water for reconstitution and extra effort in preparation. I Bottled foods. They are generally too heavy and bulky, and break easily. I Meal-sized canned foods. They are usually bulky and heavy. I Whole grains, beans, pasta. Preparation could be complicated under the circumstances of a disaster. If your electricity goes off: I First, use perishable food and foods from the refrigerator. I Then, use the foods from the freezer. To minimize the number of times you open the freezer door, post a list of freezer contents on it. In a well-filled, well-insulated freezer, foods will usually still have ice crystals in their centers (meaning foods are safe to eat) for at least three days. I Finally, begin to use nonperishable foods and staples. Remember to store nonperishable foods for your pets. First Aid Kit Assemble a first aid kit for your Disaster Supplies Kit and one for each car. The basics for your first aid kit include: I First aid manual. I Sterile adhesive bandages in assorted sizes. I Assorted sizes of safety pins. I Cleansing agent/soap. Talking About Disaster: Guide for Standard Messages 25 Disaster Supplies Kit 26 I Latex gloves (2 pairs). I Sunscreen. I 2-inch sterile gauze pads (4–6). I 4-inch sterile gauze pads (4–6). I Triangular bandages (3). I Nonprescription drugs. I 2-inch sterile roller bandages (3 rolls). I 3-inch sterile roller bandages (3 rolls). I Scissors. I Tweezers. I Needle. I Moistened towelettes. I Antiseptic. I Thermometer. I Tongue depressor blades (2). I Tube of petroleum jelly or other lubricant. Have the following nonprescription drugs in your Disaster Supplies Kit: I Aspirin or nonaspirin pain reliever. I Antidiarrhea medication. I Antacid (for stomach upset). I Syrup of ipecac (use to induce vomiting if advised by the poison control center). I Laxative. I Activated charcoal (use if advised by the poison control center). I Vitamins. Add any necessary prescription and nonprescription drugs. Add special needs for infants, elderly persons, or anyone with serious allergies. Important Documents Keep the following original documents in a safe deposit box if possible, and copies in a waterproof, fire-resistant portable container: I Will, insurance policies, contracts, deeds, stocks and bonds. I Passports, social security cards, immunization records. I Bank account numbers. I Credit card account numbers and companies. I Inventory of valuable household goods, important telephone numbers. I Family records (birth, marriage, death certificates). Talking About Disaster: Guide for Standard Messages 27 --- Content from Copy of Earthquake Preparedness --- Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General Provincial Emergency Program EARTHQUAKE PREPAREDNESS BEFORE, DURING AND AFTER Earthquakes are common in BC and more than 1,200 are recorded each year across the province. The coast of BC is considered to be a high-risk earthquake zone. In this region, tectonic plates are moving apart, sliding past one another and colliding. It is the movement of these plates that causes small earthquakes (daily), potentially damaging earthquakes (decades apart), and some of the world’s largest earthquakes (centuries apart). Earthquakes strike without warning, so it is important to act now to get prepared. Before the Shaking Starts Prepare Your Family Know the safe spots in each room― against inside walls, under sturdy tables, desks or archways. Know the danger spots― windows, mirrors, hanging objects, fireplaces and tall, unsecured furniture. Practice family drills. Physically place yourself in safe locations. This is especially important for children. Learn first aid and CPR. Keep a listing of emergency numbers. Prepare a family emergency kit with supplies for at least 72 hours. Prepare Your Home Learn how to shut off gas, water and electricity. Keep breakables or heavy objects on bottom shelves. Secure tall heavy furniture which could topple, such as bookcases, china cabinets or wall units. Secure the water heater and appliances. Secure hanging plants and heavy picture frames or mirrors (especially over beds). Put latches on cabinet doors to hold closed during shaking. Keep flammable or hazardous liquids such as paints, pest sprays or cleaning products in the garage or outside shed. Check chimneys, roofs, walls, foundations for structural condition. Maintain emergency food, water and other supplies, including flashlight, a portable battery-operated radio, extra batteries, medicines, first aid kit and clothing. La | Bunarosnry PRA. ce a oe Bhs . ManagementBC During the Shaking If indoors, stay there. Drop, cover and hold. Get under a desk or table and hang on. Alternately, you can stand in an archway or corner. If outdoors, get into an open area away from trees, buildings, walls and power lines. If in a high-rise building, stay away from windows and outside walls. Get under a table. Do not use the elevators. If driving, pull your car to the side of the road and stop. Avoid overpasses or power lines. Remain inside until the shaking is over. If in a crowded public place, do not rush for the doors. Move away from display shelves containing objects that may fall. In all instances, drop, cover and hold; protect your head as much as possible. After the Shaking Stops Stay calm and check for injuries. Apply first aid if qualified. Do not move any seriously injured individuals unless they are in immediate danger. Check for fires, gas and water leaks and damaged electrical wiring or sewer lines. If you smell gas, do not use matches, candles, etc. and do not operate electrical switches. Check building for cracks and damage, including roof, chimneys and foundation. If you suspect there is serious damage, turn off all utilities and leave the building. Check food and water supplies. Emergency water may be obtained from water heaters, melted ice cubes, toilet tanks and canned vegetables. Seek sources of uncontaminated water. In an emergency, purify water by straining through a paper towel or several layers of clean cloth and by boiling vigorously for at least six minutes. Do not use BBQ’s, camp stoves or unvented heaters indoors. Do not flush toilet if sewer line is damaged. Do not use the telephone unless there is a severe injury or fire to report. Turn on your portable radio for instructions and news reports, and cooperate fully with public safety officials. Keep Disaster Response Routes clear for emergency vehicles. Be prepared for aftershocks. Movement of the ground is seldom the actual cause of death or injury. Most casualties result from partial building collapse, falling objects and debris, like toppling chimneys, ceiling plaster and light fixtures. Remember – Stay calm and lend a hand to others in need. Feb2006 --- Content from Copy of Earthquakes --- Avoiding Earthquake Damage: A Checklist for Homeowners FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY Once an earthquake hits, it’s too late to protect your home and belongings. But there are ways to limit future earthquake damage. Sometimes only a litle time and a few dollars are all you need. This homeowners’ checklist will help you learn how to protect your home and belongings from earth- quakes. It does not cover every method. If you\\'re building or remodeling a home, there are many other options to consider for protecting your property. To learn more, call your local emergency management office and building department. Other sources of information include professional home builders, architects, structural engineers and building supply retailers. And remember to ask your building department about building permit requirements. + Do you know your earthquake risk? Ask your local emergency manage- ment office, building department or American Red Cross Chapter about earthquakes in your area. They\\'ll have information about pro- tecting your family and property. Is the house securely anchored to the foundation? If your home has a perimeter foun- dation, make sure the sill plate of the house is securely bolted to the foundation. Consult with your building department before deciding what to do. If your house has wood studs that extend from the foundation to the underside of the first floor (known as cripple walls), make sure they have adequate bracing, such as ply- wood or structural grade particle board. The bottom of the bracing should be nailed to the sill plate. A variety of products called “hold downs” are available for securing walls to the foundation. ‘Test the wood near the foundation by probing it with a pointed instru- ment. If you can penetrate the wood easily, it probably has wood decay and should be replaced with new pressure-treated wood. Have a contractor inspect any deep cracks in the foundation. 1s the chimney properly secured? Masonry chimneys pose a real haz- ard in earthquakes, especially the free-standing section above the roof line. To prevent the chimney from breaking away from the house, you may need to have it secured to the framing of the roof with sheet metal straps and angle bracing. Have the chimney inspected professional to determine the best method. » Are pictures, mirrors, shelves and light fixtures properly secured? Anchor eyebolts to wall studs for hanging heavy items such as pic- tures, mirrors and shelving. Make sure picture wires are securely attached to picture frames. Hang things away from beds and places where people sit. Make sure over- head light fixtures and hanging plants are anchored to the structural support above the ceiling. » Are televisions, computers and stereo equipment properly secured? ‘There are a variety of products designed to protect home equip- ment in an earthquake. These include adhesive-backed latches; nylon and elastic cords; wire, plastic and elastic guardrails; and shelf edges to prevent equipment from falling on the floor. » Are fuel tanks and wood- burning stoves securely anchored? Fuel oil and propane tanks can slide or overturn in an earth- quake, rupturing the tank or breaking the supply line and causing a fire. They should be securely anchored to the floor. Propane tanks are the property of the propane company, so you\\'ll need written permission to anchor them. Ask whether the company can do it first. Move tall, heavy objects that could fall and rupcure the fuel tank in an earthquake. Have a contractor instal a flexible hose connection between the tank and supply line, and where the supply line enters the house. ‘Wood-burning and other free standing stoves also pose a fire hazard in an earthquake and should be anchored to the floor. Fasten stovepipe sections togeth- er t0 prevent separation. You will most likely need a con- tractor for this work. Make sure all work conforms with local building codes. $ Is the water heater securely strapped in place? Strapping the water heater to wall studs and having flexible gas and water lines installed will greatly reduce the risk of fire and water damage in an earthquake. Water heater in comer or closet Materials + 314” x 24 gauge perforated steel plumber’s tape + 1/4” diameter x 3” lag screws and flat washers or 1/4” expand- able anchors with 2” embedment for concrete or masonry walls Directions * The water heater should be 1” to 12” away from the corner walls. Locate the wall studs on both sides of the water heater (not behind it). ‘Anchor plumber\\'s tape (a flexi- ble steel strap) to a wall stud with a 1/4\" diameter x 3” lag screw and flat washer. + From about 9” from the top of the tank, wrap the plumber\\'s tape all the way around the tank in a clockwise direction. ‘Then anchor the tape to the stud on the other wall. Make sure the tape is tight. + Repeat the process, again about 9” from the top of the tank, but this time wrap the tape in a counter clockwise direction. + Repeat the process two more times about 4\" from the bot- com of the tank.

If you\\'re using gas, have your utility company ora licensed plumber install a flexible hose where the gas line connects to the water heater at its base. Install flexible hoses for the ‘water connections as well. + Is heavy; tall furniture away from high risk areas? Consider each piece of heavy, tall furniture in the house, such as bookcases, china hutches and storage racks. Ask yourself whether the item could fall over, hurt someone or block an exit in an earthquake. You can reduce the risk by moving furniture away from doors and places where people spend the most time such as couches and beds. You should also secure tall furni- ture to wall studs, as described in the next answer. » Are kitchen and laundry equipment securely anchored? All large kitchen and laundry equipment should be securely anchored to the floor, wall or countertop, depending on the item. Such equipment includes stoves and ovens, builtin and countertop microwave ovens, garbage compactors, dishwashers, refrigerators and freezers, clothes washers and dryers, and ironing equipment. » Is heavy, tall furniture securely fastened to wall studs? ‘Anchor heavy, tall furniture to vertical wall studs, concrete or masonry with steel angle brack- ets. Even large, heavy objects that appear stable should be secured to the wall. The heavier the furniture, the stronger the restraints need to be. A heavily loaded file cabinet requires much stronger restraints to keep it from overturning than a light file cabinet with the same dimensions. Make sure the screws penetrate the studs behind the wall. Gypsum board, drywall, plaster and other wall coverings are not strong enough to hold heavy fur- niture during an earthquake. For wood studs (typically located 16 or 24 inches on centers), use a minimum 1/4” diameter by 3” lag screws. For metal studs, use 12 sheet-metal screws long enough to penetrate the flange material. For concrete or masonry walls, use concrete anchor bolts. If wall studs do nor line up with the furniture, consider installing awood 2x4” or steel horizontal mounting strip to the studs near the top of the items to be anchored. Furniture can then be anchored to the mounting strip without regard to the stud locations. ‘When possible, bolt file cabinets together (and to the wall studs) to form a more stable shape. Are heavy and breakable items properly secured? Store breakable items such as bottled foods, glass and china in low, closed cabinets with latches. Keep breakable items in original packing boxes, when possible. Keep heavy objects on lower shelves. Protect fragile items that could tip over or fall off shelves. Install edge restraints (such as wood molding) on bookshelves and storage shelves, of use elastic cords or wire guardrails to keep items from falling off open shelves. Install latches on kitchen drawers and cabinets to prevent them from flying open in an earthquake. » Are hazardous materials stored in secure places? Store weed killers, pesticides and flammable products in closed cabinets with latches and on bot- com shelves. Move incompatible chemicals to prevent mixing if the containers break. If an earthquake occurs, take cover under a sturdy table or desk, cover your head and hold on to the table. If outdoors, move into the open, away from buildings, street lights and util- ity wires. You should also teach family members how and when to turn off the gas, electricity and water after an earthquake.

They need foods that are more concentrated and less rough. Most American mothers do not nurse their infants, and if a family\\'s supply of baby foods were exhausted the parents might experience the agony of seeing their baby slowly starve. Under unsanitary conditions, it is safer to make a formula 3 times a day. To do so, add 1/3 cup plus 2 teaspoons (a little less than one ounce) of instant nonfat milk powder to 1-1/3 cups (2/3 pint) of boiled water, and stir thoroughly. Then add 1 tablespoon (about 1/3 ounce, or 9 grams) of vegetable oil and 2 teaspoons of sugar, and stir. (If regular bakers\\' milk powder is used, 1/4 cup is enough when making one-third of the daily formula, 3 times a day.) If baby bottles are not at hand, milk can be spoon-fed to an infant. During a crisis, the best and most dependable food for an infant is mother\\'s milk provided the mother is assured an adequate diet. The possibility of disaster is one more reason why a mother should nurse her baby for a full year. Storing additional high-protein foods and fats for a nursing mother usually will be better insurance against her infant getting sick or starving than keeping adequate stocks of baby foods and the equipment necessary for sanitary feeding after evacuation or an attack. To give a daily vitamin supplement to a baby, a multivitamin pill should be crushed to a fine powder between two spoons and dissolved in a small amount of fluid, so that the baby can easily swallow it. If an infant does not receive adequate amounts of vitamins A, D, and C, he will develop deficiency symptoms in 1 to 3 months, depending on the amounts stored in his body. Vitamin C deficiency, the first to appear, can be prevented by giving an infant 15 mg of vitamin C each day (about 1/3 of a 50-mg vitamin C tablet, pulverized) or customary foods containing vitamin C, such as orange juice. Lacking these sources, the juice squeezed from sprouted grains or legumes can be used. If no vitamin pills or foods rich in vitamin D are available, exposure of the baby\\'s skin to sunlight will cause his body to produce vitamin D. If sufficient milk is not obtainable, even infants younger than six months should be given solid food. Solid foods for babies must be pureed to a fine texture. Using a modern baby food grinder makes pureeing quick and easy work. Under crisis conditions, a grinder should be cleaned and disinfected like other baby-feeding utensils, as described later in this section. Several expedient methods are available: the food can be pressed through a sieve, mashed with a fork or spoon, or squeezed through a porous cloth. Good sanitation must be maintained; all foods should be brought to a boil after pureeing to insure that the food is safe from bacteria. A pureed solid baby food can be made by first boiling together 3 parts of a cereal grain and 1 part of beans until they are soft. Then the mixture should be pressed through a sieve. The sieve catches the tough hulls from the grain kernels and the skins from the beans. The grain-beans combination will provide needed calories and a well- supplemented protein. The beans also supply the additional iron that a baby needs by the time he is 6 months old. Flours made from whole grains or beans, as previously described, also can be used; however, these may contain more rough material. Some grains are preferable to others. It is easier to sieve cooked corn kernels than cooked wheat kernels. Since wheat is the grain most likely to cause allergies, it should not be fed to an infant until he is 6 to 7 months old if other grains, such as rice or corn, are available. Small children also need more protein than can be supplied by grains alone. As a substitute for milk, some bean food should be provided at every meal. If the available diet is deficient in a concentrated energy source such as fat or sugar, a child\\'s feedings should be increased to 4 or 5 times a day, to enable him to assimilate more. Whenever possible, a small child should have a daily diet that contains at least one ounce of fat (3 tablespoons, without scraping the spoon). This would provide more than 10% of a young child\\'s calories in the form of fat, which would be beneficial. If under emergency conditions it is not practical to boil infant feeding utensils, they can be sterilized with a bleach solution. Add one teaspoon of ordinary household bleach to a quart of water. (Ordinary household bleach contains 5.25% sodium hypochlorite as its only active ingredient and supplies approximately 5% available chlorine. If the strength of the bleach is unknown, add 3 teaspoons per quart.) Directions for safe feeding without boiling follow: Utensils 1. Immediately after feeding, wash the inside and outside of all utensils used to prepare the formula and to feed the infant. 2. Fill a covered container with clean, cold water and add the appropriate amount of chlorine bleach. 3. Totally immerse all utensils until the next feeding (3 or 4 hours). Be sure that the bottle, if used, is filled with bleach solution. Keep container covered. At feeding time: Wash hands before preparing food. Remove utensils from the disinfectant chlorine solution and drain, but do not rinse or dry. Prepare formula; feed the baby. Immediately after feeding: Wash utensils in clean water and immerse again in the disinfectant solution. Prepare fresh chlorine solution each day. --- Content from Copy of Emergency Food Preparation --- \"Militia Cookbook\" Emergency Food Preparation Page 1 of 37 Emergency Food Preparation During wartime or a natural disaster, food shortages and lack of natural gas or electricity for cooking requires a great deal of improvisation and reliance upon back-to-basics cooking techniques used by our forefathers in order to survive. In an emergency it helps to know what to do with all the wheat, rice, cornmeal, sugar, molasses, vegetable oil and dried beans, milk, fruits and vegetables which you\\'ve wisely cached along with firewood or cooking fuel. Colonial, pioneer and nineteenth century military cooking methods and recipes are useful when preparing meals from simple cached staples. Many of the recipes included in this information paper don\\'t need perishables like meat, eggs or yeast, which you might not have. Recipes for the modern kitchen with a temperature-controlled oven will naturally have to be adjusted by trial and error if you are baking in a clay oven in the field or cooking over a campfire. Improvisation is called for to substitute what is available. For example if a recipe calls for bacon drippings, you can use any cooking fat like lard, margarine, butter, vegetable oil or shortening. Butter Flavor Crisco can be used in most recipes, doesn\\'t require refrigeration and is available in easy to measure sticks. The interaction between a sweetener, baking soda and buttermilk or sour milk (which you can make by adding a little vinegar to reconstituted dry milk; 1 tablespoon per cup of milk and let stand 5 minutes) can substitute for yeast if none is available. White hardwood ashes can replace baking powder as a leavening agent. Honey, molasses or syrups and be substituted for sugar in most recipes by using less water. 1 cup honey = 1-1/4 cup sugar plus 1/4 cup liquid. Use whatever dried fruit is available regardless of what the recipe calls for. Experimentation is the order of the day. If you remember to add spices in stages (they can\\'t be removed if you use too much) and if all of the ingredients you use are food, then the chances are the end result will be edible (especially if you are hungry enough). \"Militia Cookbook\" Emergency Food Preparation Page 2 of 37 Sources of Recipes Living history reenactors of the American Revolution and the War of Northern Aggression take great delight in recreating authentic army meals around their campfires and hardcore reenactors actually eat the mess. Patricia B. Mitchell has published a series of cookbooks (available from Sims-Mitchell House Bed & Breakfast, 242 Whittle Street SW, P.O. Box 429, Chatham, VA 24531) to make this task easier and many excerpts from her books \"Revolutionary Recipes,\" \"Union Army Camp Cooking,\" \"Confederate Camp Cooking,\" \"Confederate Home Cooking\" and \"Cooking for the Cause\" are included in this paper. Some recipes have been included from \"Colonial Treasure Cookbook\" (Hutcraft, High Point, NC 27262) and from \"Colonial Fireplace Cooking & Early American Recipes\" (Shoestring Press, 430 N. Harrison, East Lansing, MI 48823). Regional cookbooks, especially from the South, are a source of recipes for nutritional meals from simple foods. Recipes have been included from various southern cookbooks including \"Cookin\\' Yankees Ain\\'t Et\" (The Merry Mountaineers, Highlands, NC 28741), \"Southern Recipes\" and \"Piggin\\' Out in Dixie\" (Southern Cookbooks, P.O. Box 100905, Nashville, TN 37224). Recipes and field cooking techniques have also been excerpted from \"The Green Beret Gourmet\" (The Guttenberg Press Publications, P.O. Box 973, Rockledge, FL 32955). Some quick bread recipes which don\\'t require yeast come from \"Sunset Breads\" (Sunset Publishing Corp., Menlo Park, CA 94025), a cookbook with recipes from all over the world. If you have active dry yeast or sourdough starter, this book is an excellent reference for other bread recipes not included in this paper. Vegetarian cookbooks should also be a good source of survival recipes, but being a confirmed carnivore, the writer of this paper has no personal knowledge of any such books. Backpacking books are also an excellent source of field cooking techniques and recipes. There is a chapter on field nutrition and camp cooking as well as an extensive appendix of recipes in \"The National Outdoor Leadership School\\'s Wilderness Guide\" (Simon & Schuster, Inc., Simon & Schuster Building, Rockefeller Center, 1230 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10020). \"Roughing It Easy\" by Dian Thomas (The Dian Thomas Company, P.O. Box 171107, Holladay, UT 84117; 1-800-846-6355) is a comprehensive collection of outdoor cooking recipes and techniques, including many variations on improvised tin can stoves and ovens, pit and open fire cooking, dutch oven cooking, building a solar reflector cooker or solar oven and a section on drying fruits, vegetables and jerky. \"Militia Cookbook\" Emergency Food Preparation Page 3 of 37 The Improvised Kitchen You should have a camping stove for emergency cooking purposes. Two-burner stoves are useful in a fixed location or if you are vehicle mobile. Propane stoves are easy to use but fuel is expensive, the high pressure steel canisters are heavy and not likely to be widely available during a long-term emergency. A multifuel stove capable of using either white gas (lantern fuel or Coleman fuel) or ordinary gasoline is easier to resupply in an emergency. However, gasoline burns hotter than propane and is not as useful for low heat simmering of foods, so it might be wise to have both types of stove. If you are in a fixed location like a survival retreat or base camp, nothing beats a cast iron skillet, covered kettle and especially a dutch oven for open fire or hot coal cooking. An excellent configuration for a cooking fire is the keyhole type. Build a fire ring of rocks with a rectangular extension, build a fire in the circular part and coals can be raked or shoveled into the rectangular cooking area as needed. A grill or griddle can be supported over the rectangular cooking area (bricks can be used instead of rocks here for more stability) or the area can be used with a dutch oven. A metal tripod (or one fashioned from green branches) to hang a kettle can be used for boiling water or directly cooking over the flames in the circular part of the fire ring. The book \"Roughing It Easy\" shows how useful heavy duty aluminum foil is for outdoor cooking; stock up. Also, if you store food in large 10 cans (1 gallon) or in five gallon square cans, get this book and a pair of tin snips to convert the empty cans into many useful stove and oven variations. A cookie cooling rack can be used over a small pit of coals or an improvised 10 can barbecue. A grill and dutch oven can be arranged to allow simultaneous use as a baking oven and for frying. Dig a shallow hole 9 to 12 inches in diameter and 3 to 4 inches deep; place coals or charcoal briquets in the hole and place the grill across the hole; put the pan containing the item to be baked on the grill and cover with an inverted dutch oven; place coals on the base of the dutch oven which is now the top; place the inverted dutch oven lid on the base tripod legs and it becomes a griddle for frying foods. Another useful accessory for either base camp cooking or for use in the field is a folding pack grill. Such a grill can be used for directly broiling meats, as a stand over the coals for a skillet, griddle or a stock pot (used for soups and stews, as a steamer or as an oven for baking or roasting), as a reflector oven (using disposable aluminum cooking pans for reflectors), as a stand for an inverted dutch oven lid allowing it to be used for frying, as a dirt free stand for placing a dutch oven lid when adding ingredients to or checking the progress of food in the oven and as a stand away from the fire for serving or for safely adding ingredients without burning yourself or spilling the food. The Coghlan\\'s brand pack grill is cheap enough (about $3 to $4 in discount stores) that several can be purchased for use in a base camp. A single pack grill and a lightweight nesting cooking set or GI mess kit can be carried in your rucksack to simplify field cooking. You can also add a folding pocket stove or GI canteen cup stand and solid fuel tablets to your rucksack for reheating prepared foods or preparing hot beverages like instant soup, coffee, tea or cocoa. To ease the cleanup chore when reheating cooked food, immerse the food container (can, MRE pouch, vacuum seal bag or freezer bag) in boiling water in your cooking pot; pierce the food container above the water line so it doesn\\'t explode. In the field this method of heating food reduces cooking odors and lessens the chance of giving away your unit\\'s position to enemy scouts. A single-burner butane or multifuel backpacking stove can be shared between two or three people. Most butane cartridges nowadays are filled with iso-butane which can be used down to about 20 degrees but, like with two-burner camp stoves, a multifuel stove is easier to resupply. Get an extra GI canteen cover and you can carry your stove attached to the side of your GI rucksack. \"Militia Cookbook\" Emergency Food Preparation Page 4 of 37 If you are on the move without a vehicle or pack animals to carry heavy cooking vessels like cast iron skillets and dutch ovens (or in case you get separated from your well stocked rucksack), here are some of the many other ways of cooking food using natural materials described in \"The Green Beret Gourmet\": Clay Ovens: Construct an arched structure of green sticks (similar in shape to a beehive), insert a thick stick vertically through the top to form a flue opening and daub with wet clay until it is completely covered except for a front opening. Pile on successive layers of clay until a thick wall is made. Allow the layers to dry between applications by either placing hot coals inside or, if time is not a problem, by the sun. If each layer is not thoroughly dry, the oven will crack when you try to use it. A clay oven can also be made by hammering a thick sharpened stick down through a bank or slope about three feet back from the edge. Scoop out the size of the oven you want about a foot or so down the bank. Leave a thick ceiling. Leave a narrow front opening and dig back and hollow the bank as far as the stick which you hammered down. Pull the stick out to form the chimney opening. Wet your hands and smooth the interior surfaces, then harden the walls by building a small fire inside. After your oven is prepared, to use it build a fire inside. When the fire has burned down, scrape out the coals and ashes. Lay food inside on stones, leaves or hardwood slabs. Close off the front opening and flue. Leave food inside to cook. Cooking time depends upon the type of food being cooked. Cooking in Natural Containers: A stone with a hollow in it makes an excellent container. If it is small enough you can build a fire around the stone. Bark can be used to fashion pots to boil water, cook soups, stews or any foods with liquids over a fire. Peel a square of bark and fold the corners inward and hold them in place with wooden pegs. Keep the flames from touching your bark pot above the liquid level and your meal will cook in this simple container. Large leaves make an instant \"aluminum foil\" when baking or steaming food, but be sure to use edible nonpoisonous leaves. Baking in Clay. This method is excellent for small game or fish. Remove the entrails from the animal being prepared. This is easiest to do if the animal is already dead. Do not skin, pluck or scale. Cover with a layer of clay about an inch thick. Place it in hot ashes and build a fire above it. Cooking time varies with animal size and taste preference. A one pound animal will be cooked in approximately 30 to 40 minutes. The meat will be stripped clean of fur, feathers or scales when you break off the clay. Baking on a Stick. Heat a peeled green stick by the fire while you prepare a bread dough. Mix a GI canteen cup of flour with a mound of baking powder the size of a quarter and a dash of salt. Add water gradually to make a soft dough. Work quickly so the bread will rise as it bakes. Wrap dough around heated stick and place upright next to the fire to let it bake. Cooking in Ashes. Foodstuff is placed in warm ashes and then covered with embers. Self-contained foods such as vegetables do not need to be wrapped in anything; simply place them in the ashes and dust them off after cooking. Cooking time depends upon the type of food and personal preferences. You can test vegetables by feeling for softness and putting them back if they still feel firm. Cooking on Wood Slabs. Select a green hardwood slab (evergreens season the food with a pine or turpentine taste) large enough to lash or peg the animal. Fish and very small game can be successfully cooked this way. Clean the animal and flatten down on the slab. Either pin the animal down with wooden pegs or lash to the slab with whatever is available. Lean the slab up in front of glowing coals. Turn a few times so the food will cook evenly. \"Militia Cookbook\" Emergency Food Preparation Page 5 of 37 This recipe comes from Richmond, Virginia in the Confederate States of America when Yankee invaders were marauding and food was in short supply: Roasted Rat The rat must be skinned, cleaned, his head cut off and his body laid upon a square board, the legs stretched to their full extent and secured upon it with small tacks, then baste with bacon fat and roast before a good fire quickly like canvasback ducks. Broiling on a Stick. This is a good method for cooking a small amount of food. Fish, birds and small animals (large animals must be cut into smaller chunks) can be cleaned and then skewered on a peeled green wood stick. If the food tends to slide, a bark twine can be used to tie it down by splitting the wood down to the game on both ends and twisting bark through the splits. Sear the meat in the flame to seal in the juices. The skewer can be laid over forked green sticks at both ends of an ember bed. As long as the fire does not flame up, the meat needs only occasional turning so it cooks evenly. Steaming in a Hole. This method can be used to cook small or enormous amounts of food with great results. Build a fire and place some stones in it to heat. Don\\'t select rocks from a stream bed, limestone or sandstone since they can contain trapped moisture and may explode when heated. While the stones are heating, dig a hole. Put the stones in the pit and place a thick layer of wet vegetation like grass or seaweed over them. Lay the food on top of the wet vegetation and place a stick near the edge of the pit. Fill with dirt. Pull the stick out and pour water down this opening onto the rocks to steam the food. Tamp down the top and leave the food to steam for at least two or three hours. If you are cooking something larger than fish or small game, the cooking time will need to be extended. Grilling Meat can be grilled over the coals if it is fat. Lean game will end up very dry. Build a bed of hardwood embers and place a grill matting of green sticks on it. Place the meat on the grill and turn immediately after the sides are seared to seal in the juices. Try not to pierce the meat with whatever you are turning it with so you don\\'t lose any juices. Keep a small container of water nearby to douse any flames that surface from the fat drippings. \"Militia Cookbook\" Emergency Food Preparation Page 6 of 37 Fire Cake and Hoe Cakes One of the easiest ways of making flour edible, even if not very appetizing, is to make a simple dough and fry or bake it over a fire. During the Revolutionary War it was common for soldiers to make a thick paste of flour and water (salt was added when available) and then bake it on hot rocks around a campfire. The result was an unpalatable, chewy, soggy glob which only the starving soldiers at Valley Forge probably appreciated. Hoe cakes were made from a corn meal dough carried to the fields by slaves and other farm workers. At lunch they cleaned their hoes, put the dough on them and cooked it over a fire. Entrenching Tool Cake 4 GI canteen cups white cornmeal boiling water 1 GI mess kit spoon (1 tablespoon) bacon drippings GI mess kit spoon salt Scald cornmeal with enough boiling water to make a stiff batter, then add bacon drippings and salt. Shape into pones, leaving the imprint of four fingers across top. Place batter on the cleaned, greased blade of an entrenching tool and set up next to fire to bake. Corn Pone 2 cups cornmeal 3/4 tsp. salt (or less) boiling water 2 tbsp. butter or margarine, melted; or vegetable oil Combine all ingredients to make a semi-stiff mush. Spread 1/4-inch thick in a well-greased heavy pan and bake at 375 degrees 20 to 25 minutes. Corn pones used to be baked on a greased shovel over glowing coals. \"Militia Cookbook\" Emergency Food Preparation Page 7 of 37 Hardtack During the War for Southern Independence, hardtack was a staple food (when fresh bread was unavailable) for both the brutal soldiers of the oppressive Federal government and the brave Confederate patriots defending their homeland. Hardtack was a virtually indestructible 1/2-inch thick cracker about three inches by three inches, pierced with sixteen holes and made from flour and water. Tack was a contemptuous term for food and the soldiers \"affectionately\" referred to hardtack as worm castles, sheet iron crackers and tooth dullers. Some of the hardtack issued to soldiers in the 1860\\'s was supposedly left over from the 1846-48 Mexican War. The daily ration was nine or ten crackers, but there was usually enough for those who wanted more since some men would not draw a full ration. They were eaten plain, soaked in coffee or crumbled and added to the stew pot. A dish known as Skillygalee was made by soaking hardtack in cold water and then browning it in pork fat and seasoning to taste. A favorite seasoning of the times was cayenne pepper. Confederate Cush provided a dinner entree that consisted of bits of cooked beef, seasoned with garlic, fried in bacon grease and then stewed with crumbled hardtack or cornmeal mush. The crackers included in military C-rations and the current MREs are similar to hardtack, being much more dense, containing more flour and less air than commercial saltine crackers. When fresh, hardtack was not unappetizing, but when boxes of hardtack sat on railroad platforms or warehouses for months before being issued it hardened and often became insect infested. Because hardtack was packed in boxes marked \"B.C.\" (probably for \"Brigade Commissary\"), soldiers said they were so hard because they were baked \"Before Christ\". The following account from a Yankee invader indicates how much hardtack was appreciated: \"While before Petersburg, doing siege work in the summer of 1864, our men had wormy hardtack, or ship\\'s biscuit, served out to them for a time. It was a severe trial, and it tested the temper of the men. Breaking open the biscuit and finding live worms in them, they would throw the pieces in the trenches where they were doing duty day by day, although the orders were to keep the trenches clean for sanitary reasons. A brigade officer of the day, seeing some of the scraps along our front, called out sharply to our men \\'Throw that hardtack out of the trenches.\\' Then, as the men men promptly gathered it up as directed, he added, \\'Don\\'t you know that you\\'ve no business to throw hardtack in the trenches? Haven\\'t you been told that often enough?\\' Out from the injured soldier heart there came the reasonable explanation \\'We\\'ve thrown it out two or three times, sir, but it crawls back.\\'\" Hardtack (original 1860\\'s recipe) Use one part water to six parts flour. Roll dough flat and score into cracker shapes. Bake 20-25 minutes and cool off until completely dry before storing in canisters. The crackers should be hard as bricks and indestructibly unappetizing. If not consumed by hungry soldiers, the crackers might last at least until the Lord returns! The following recipes don\\'t duplicate the indestructible nature of 19th century hardtack, but they are more appetizing since they are made from more than just flour and water: Corntack 1-1/4 cups cornmeal 1 cup water (about) 1/2 tsp. salt 2 tbsp. vegetable oil Combine the above ingredients, using enough water to moisten. Bake in a greased 7x11-inch pan at 375 degrees for around 15 minutes, or until the edges begin to brown slightly. While still warm, cut into squares. A modern day cross between hardtack and cornbread, these thick crackers are actually pleasantly tasty served warm or reheated. \"Militia Cookbook\" Emergency Food Preparation Page 8 of 37 Swedish Hardtack 1 cup water 3 tbsp. vegetable oil 3 tbsp. honey 3 cups rye flour (or 1-1/2 cups rye & 1-1/2 cups whole wheat flour) 1-1/2 tbsp. brewer\\'s yeast (optional) 1/4 tsp. salt Mix liquids together. In a separate bowl, mix dry ingredients. Combine the mixtures, stirring to moisten throughout. Form a ball. On a floured surface, flatten the dough, and roll out thinly. Cut into squares and prick each cracker with the tines of a fork a couple of times. Transfer to lightly greased baking sheets. Bake at 425 degrees around 8 minutes, checking to be sure not to over- brown. Best served warm. Southern Soda Crackers 2 cups flour (preferably whole wheat) 1/4 tsp. salt 1/2 tsp. baking soda 2 tbsp. oil 2/3 cup sour milk (or buttermilk) Mix dry ingredients. Add oil and sour milk. With a fork, stir to thoroughly moisten. Form a ball. Flatten and roll out on a floured surface. Cut into squares and transfer to lightly greased baked sheets. Prick crackers with a fork. Bake at 350 degrees for about 8-10 minutes, watching vigilantly so as not to burn. Best served warm. \"Militia Cookbook\" Emergency Food Preparation Page 9 of 37 Cornbread Red meats are complete proteins containing all of the essential amino acids needed by the body to build and maintain muscle and other tissues. Most vegetables don\\'t contain all of the necessary amino acids (although soybeans contain most) and are referred to as incomplete proteins. The Confederate army marched and fought on a staple diet of cornbread and beans, combining incomplete proteins to provide good nutrition. Southern Cornbread 2 cups cornmeal 1/2 tsp. salt 1/2 tsp. baking soda 2 tsp. baking powder 1-1/4 cups buttermilk (or sour milk) 1 egg, well beaten 1/4 cup melted grease (your choice) Preheat oven at 425 degrees. Mix cornmeal, salt, soda, baking powder and sugar. Add buttermilk and egg. Blend well. Heat grease (until it almost smokes) in an 8 or 9 inch iron skillet, then pour most of the grease into the batter and stir, mixing well. Pour batter into the very hot skillet. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, or until nicely browned. Molasses Cornbread or Muffins 1-1/2 cups bran 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/2 cup cornmeal 1 tbsp. baking powder 1/4 tsp. salt 1/4 cup sugar 1/3 cup vegetable oil 2 eggs, beaten 1 cup milk 1/3 cup molasses Combine dry ingredients. Add liquid and blend well. Pour into a greased 9x9x2-inch baking dish and bake at 375 degrees for 30 minutes; or pour into 18 greased muffin tins and bake at 375 degrees for 20 minutes. Grandma Sarah\\'s Cornbread 1-1/2 cups sour milk or buttermilk 2 eggs 1 tbsp. sugar 1/2 tsp. salt 1/2 tsp. baking soda 1-1/2 cups cornmeal 1/2 cup flour 1/4 cup melted butter Combine first five ingredients. Stir in cornmeal and flour. Add melted butter. Pour batter into greased 8-inch square pan. Bake at 425 degrees for 30 minutes. \"Militia Cookbook\" Emergency Food Preparation Page 10 of 37 A Lady\\'s Touch Cornbread 1 cup cornmeal 1 cup whole wheat, unbleached or all-purpose flour 2 tbsp. sugar (optional) 1 tbsp. baking powder 1/4 to 1/2 tsp. salt 1 egg, beaten (optional) 3 tbsp. vegetable oil 1-1/4 cup milk Combine the dry ingredients. Stir in the liquids and spoon into a greased 8-inch square pyrex dish. Bake at 400 degrees for 20 minutes. The recipe can be easily doubled and baked in a 9x13-inch pyrex dish. Country Sunshine Cornmeal Loaves 4 cups yellow cornmeal 2 cups all-purpose flour 2 tsp. baking powder 2 tsp. baking soda 3/4 tsp. salt 1/2 cup sugar 6 tbsp. butter or margarine, melted 4 cups buttermilk or sour milk Mix dry ingredients. Stir in butter and buttermilk. Blend well. Pour batter into two greased 9x5- inch loaf pans. Let stand 15 minutes. Bake at 350 degrees for one hour. (Note: no eggs required for this recipe) Johnny Cake or Journey Cake 1 cup cornmeal 1 tbsp. salt 1 cup water 1/2 cup milk Stir cornmeal and salt into boiling water. Cook until thick. Remove from heat and add milk. Mix well. Drop from large spoon on greased hot griddle or skillet. Turn to brown both sides. Johnny Cakes 1 cup cornmeal 1/2 tsp. salt 1 tsp. sugar 1-1/2 cups boiling water 1/2 cup milk In a bowl combine the cornmeal, salt and sugar. Stir in water, beating out lumps. Slowly add milk. Drop by tablespoons full into greased skillet. Cook slowly for 5 minutes. Turn over and cook 5 minutes more. Makes 10 cakes. Dixie Corn Dodgers 2 cups cornmeal 1/2 tsp. salt 2 tsp. baking powder 2 tbsp, vegetable oil, melted butter, or bacon drippings 2/3 cup milk (approximately) Combine the dry ingredients. Stir in liquids. Form eight \"bullet-shaped\" dodgers. Drop in a greased and heated heavy skillet. Brown on one side, turn to brown bottom. \"Militia Cookbook\" Emergency Food Preparation Page 11 of 37 Campfire Cornbread 1 cup cornmeal 1 cup flour 2 tsp. baking powder 3/4 tsp. salt 1 cup milk 1/4 cup vegetable oil Mix dry ingredients. Stir in liquids. Spoon into a well-greased, heated 10 or 12 inch skillet. Cover tightly. Cover over a low flame for 20 to 30 minutes, or until firm in the center. When pan baking over hot coals place the pan on a low grill, on a three rock stand in the coals or directly on coals. Place coals on top of the lid (like a dutch oven) to distribute heat more evenly. Baked foods are more likely to burn on the bottom than the top. To prevent burning, check the temperature of your coals before placing a pan on them. Hold your hand about six inches above the coals; it should be hot, but you should be able to keep your hand in place for eight seconds. No-Flour Camp Cornbread 1-1/2 cups cornmeal 1 tsp. salt 1 tsp. baking soda 1 tbsp. sugar, molasses, sorghum, or honey 2 cups buttermilk or sour milk (To sour milk, put 2 tbsp. lemon juice or vinegar in a pint measuring cup. Add milk to make 2 cups. Stir and let sit a few minutes until clabbered.) 2 eggs, beaten 1 tbsp butter or margarine, melted (or other fat) Mix dry ingredients. Stir in liquids. Spoon into a well-greased hot 10 or 12 inch iron skillet. Cover and cook over a low flame for about 30 minutes or until firm in the center (or bake in the oven at 425 degrees for approximately 30 minutes). Hush Puppies 2 cups yellow cornmeal 1 tbsp. flour 1 tbsp. sugar 1 tsp. baking powder 3/4 tsp. baking soda 1/4 cup finely chopped onion 1-1/4 cups buttermilk 1 egg, well beaten lard or cooking oil for deep frying, heated to 375 degrees Mix dry ingredients together and make a well in the center. In a separate bowl mix buttermilk and beaten egg. Pour in the well all at one time and mix until well blended. Using a heaping tablespoon for each, form into small cakes. Deep fry only as many as will float uncrowded one layer deep. Turn several times as they rise to the surface during cooking (do not pierce). Fry 3 to 4 minutes or until well browned. Drain a few seconds before transferring to paper towels. Serve hot. (Note: At fish frys the dogs would start howling from the aroma of the cooking fish and hush puppies were thrown to shut them up.) \"Militia Cookbook\" Emergency Food Preparation Page 12 of 37 Cornmeal Pancakes 2 tsp. sugar 1 tsp. salt 1 tbsp. baking powder 1-1/4 cups sifted flour 3/4 cup cornmeal 2 eggs, well beaten 1-1/4 cups milk 3 tbsp. melted shortening Sift together sugar, salt, baking powder and flour. Stir in cornmeal. Combine eggs and milk and add to flour mixture. Add shortening and mix until smooth. Drop by tablespoons full on a greased hot griddle. Cook until edges are brown and bubbles are in the middle. Turn and cook on other side. Serve with butter and sorghum, molasses or other syrup. \"Militia Cookbook\" Emergency Food Preparation Page 13 of 37 Beans There is an old saying, \"Beans, beans, good for the heart, the more you eat beans the more your health will improve.\" All varieties of dried beans except split peas and lentils need to be soaked before cooking. Beans tend to retain their shape better with a long soak. Cooking Dried Beans. To prepare dried beans (1 pound of dried beans = about 2 cups raw or 5 to 6 cups cooked), place washed beans in a pot with 2 to 3 times their volume of water (1 pound of beans needs 4 to 6 cups). Let stand 8 to 12 hours. To quick soak, bring water and beans to a boil and allow to boil 2 minutes. Cover pot and let stand 1 hour. The time required for cooking beans is generally 1-1/2 to 2 hours, but this depends upon the variety of bean and the length of time they have been stored. Check beans often as they begin to get tender so they don\\'t get mushy. Cook at a gentle simmer with the lid tilted to retain shape. If beans foam up during cooking, add a tablespoon of oil or fat to the water or cook with a small amount of fat pork or bacon. If a recipe calls for tomatoes, lemon juice or vinegar, add when beans are almost tender or acid will slow the softening process. Beans can also be prepared for quick-cooking in camp like minute rice. Cook them normally until tender, drain and dry them in a food dryer or spread them on a flat pan and dry in a warm oven or in the sun. Store in airtight canisters. They can then be reconstituted in water by boiling about 20 minutes. Trench Beans 1 lb. dry pinto beans, cooked 1 tbsp. seasoned salt 1 tbsp. worcestershire sauce 1 tbsp. A-1 Steak Sauce 1/8 tsp. Tabasco 1 tsp. lemon pepper 1 tsp. onion powder Soak and cook beans. When tender, add seasonings and simmer an additional 30 minutes. Battalion Baked Beans 1 large can pork and beans 1/2 cup tomato catsup 6 small onions (or 1 jar small onions) 1/2 cup brown sugar 1 tsp. vinegar 2 tbsp. molasses 1 tsp. dry prepared mustard bacon strips Combine all ingredients except bacon and spoon into a casserole dish. Cover with strips of bacon. Bake at 300 degrees to 350 degrees for 1 hour or until the bacon is done and the beans are bubbly. Secession Baked Beans 2 cans pork and beans (or 3 cups cooked dry beans) 1/4 cup molasses 1/2 cup tomato sauce (3/4 cup if more liquid is needed) 1 medium onion, sliced into rings 1/2 tsp. dry prepared mustard 1/4 tsp. salt (or more to taste) dash of pepper 3 strips of bacon, cut in half (optional) Combine everything except bacon. Pour into 1-1/2 quart casserole dish. If you use bacon, arrange on top of the bean mixture. Bake at 325 degrees for 2 hours or 375 degrees for 1 hour. \"Militia Cookbook\" Emergency Food Preparation Page 14 of 37 Baked Beans 6 cups cooked dry beans (2 cups raw) 1 small chopped onion 1/2 cup brown sugar 2 tbsp. molasses 1 tbsp. salt 1/2 tsp. dry prepared mustard 2 slices fat pork or bacon Place half the cooked beans in a bean pot place chopped onion on top. Add remaining beans. Mix brown sugar, molasses, salt and mustard and pour on top of beans. Lay fat pork or bacon on top and cover beans with hot water. Cover bean pot and bake in a slow oven (250 degrees) for 6 hours. Uncover last hour to brown. \"Militia Cookbook\" Emergency Food Preparation Page 15 of 37 Rice and Beans Like the cornbread and beans diet of the Confederacy or the fish and rice staple diet of the Orient, rice and beans combine incomplete proteins from two different foods to form complete proteins. The combination of rice and beans is a staple diet for much of the world\\'s population. You can top the Carolina Red Rice recipe with cooked dried beans (seasoned to taste). Use the recipes for Hopping John (a colonial dish served on New Year\\'s Day to insure good luck) as guidelines and substitute whatever type of beans you have available. Try adding canned chili and tomato sauce or salsa to cooked rice (or make your own chili with meat, tomato sauce and chili seasonings) and add it to any rice and bean mix (seasoned to taste with hot sauce). Cooking Rice Instant or minute rice, while good for cooking in the field, won\\'t store for long periods (without vacuum or nitrogen packing) since it has already been cooked and then dried. To prepare regular long grain white rice (1 cup uncooked rice = about 3 cups cooked rice), rinse lightly and drain the water. Add one cup of water and 1/2 to 1 tsp. salt (or meat stock or bouillon) for each cup of rice. Optionally, add one teaspoon of butter or oil for each cup of uncooked rice. Bring to a boil over high heat and allow to boil one minute. Cover pot, reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand for 10 minutes more. Don\\'t open lid while cooking. Bean-Rice Casserole 3 cups water 1 cup uncooked rice 1/2 cup quick-cooking black beans (see previous section for instructions on preparing quick- cooking beans or substitute cooked dried beans or a can of cooked beans) 1 tbsp. instant beef bouillon 3 tbsp. margarine 1/2 cup chopped dried apricots 1/2 cup chopped dried pineapple Put all ingredients in a frying pan and mix. Cover and cook over medium heat for about 20 minutes. Don\\'t stir while it\\'s cooking because that will make the rice gummy. When the water has been absorbed, test rice for doneness. If it\\'s still a little chewy, add a little more water and cook a few minutes more. Carolina Red Rice 1/4 lb. bacon 3/4 cup chopped onions 2 cups cooked rice 2 cups canned tomatoes (or reconstituted dried tomatoes) 1/2 tsp. salt 1/2 tsp. pepper 1/4 tsp. Tabasco sauce Cook bacon, remove from pan and crumble. Cook onions in bacon fat until tender. Add rice, tomatoes, seasonings and crumbled bacon. Cook on low heat about 35 minutes, stirring well. Stir with fork several times while cooking. Check after 15 minutes and add water if needed. Hopping John 2 cups cooked black-eyed peas 2 cups cooked rice 1 chopped onion (optional) 2 tbsp. butter dash salt, pepper and hot sauce Blend and heat slowly about 30 minutes. \"Militia Cookbook\" Emergency Food Preparation Page 16 of 37 Hopping John Soup 1 cup dry black-eyed peas (\"southern caviar\") 8 cups water 6 slices bacon 3/4 cup chopped onion 1 clove garlic, minced 1 cup regular rice 2 tsp. salt 1/4 tsp. pepper Rinse black-eyed peas. In a large saucepan add the peas and water, bring to a boil 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let stand 1 hour. Drain, setting aside 6 cups of the cooking liquid. In heavy saucepan, cook the bacon, onion and garlic until the bacon is crisp and the onion is tender but not brown. Remove the bacon, drain on paper towels: crumble and set aside. Stir the black- eyed peas, raw rice, salt, pepper and reserved cooking liquid into mixture in saucepan. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce heat. Simmer 1 hour, stirring occasionally. Stir in crumbled bacon and it\\'s ready to serve eight regular folks or two good ol\\' boys. \"Militia Cookbook\" Emergency Food Preparation Page 17 of 37 Bread and Biscuits In case of a power outage, bread bakes just as well in a dutch oven with hot coals or charcoal briquets (cooking time should be roughly the same as in your home oven). If you don\\'t do a lot of baking, you might want to invest in a set of no-stick air-bake insulated baking pans and cookie sheets, which will lessen the chance of burning your baked goods. Bread can be prepared from stockpiled staples and can be served with any meal. However, note that due to their oil content, items like wheat germ and whole wheat flour or other unprocessed flours will turn rancid without refrigeration (or freezing). It\\'s best to store whole grains, get a hand cranked mill and grind your own flour. In the face of an expected long-term power outage, you will want to preserve or use up the perishables in your refrigerator. Baking bread is a good way to use your milk, eggs and butter (substitute melted butter in recipes that call for vegetable oil) before they spoil and will give you something to put your peanut butter and jelly on or sop up some gravy. To ease this task, you may want to keep a stock of Jiffy Muffin Mix on hand (rotate periodically by using and replacing). These mixes are easy to use and are very versatile. For example, the corn muffin mix package has instructions for preparing as muffins, cornbread, corn sticks and corn pancakes or waffles. Any Jiffy Muffin Mix can be extended using the following recipe: Jiffy Muffin Mix Mini-Loaves 1 package Jiffy Muffin Mix (corn muffin, blueberry, apple-cinnamon, etc.) In addition to the ingredients listed in package recipe (e.g. corn muffins call for 1 egg and 1/3 cup milk), also use: 1/3 cup wheat germ, bran or uncooked multigrain cereal 1 tbsp. brown sugar or molasses 1/4 tsp. salt 1/3 cup raisins or chopped dried fruit (or 1/4 cup each dried fruit & chopped nuts) 1/2 tsp. baking powder 1 tbsp. melted butter or vegetable oil 1 tbsp. milk For corn muffin mix, preheat oven to 400 degrees (or temperature called for by other type muffin mix). Mix dry ingredients together. Beat remaining ingredients together in a separate bowl, then blend with dry mix. For maximum rise, let batter rest 3 or 4 minutes and then pour into two greased 3x5-1/2 inch mini-loaf pans (which will fit in a 10-inch dutch oven, by the way; set the pans on top of home-canning jar rings or pebbles placed in the bottom of the oven to let hot air circulate under the pans). Bake 15 to 20 minutes or until brown. The following quick breads (no active dry yeast required) can also be prepared to use up your milk, eggs and butter before they spoil: Logan Bread 6 eggs 3 cups flour (any mixture of whole wheat and rye) 3/4 cup wheat germ 1/4 cup brown sugar 1/2 cup powdered milk 1 cup oil 1/2 cup honey 1/4 cup molasses 1/4 cup sorghum syrup or maple syrup (any combination of these four sweeteners totaling one cup works fine) 1/2 cup shelled walnuts or pecans 1 cup dried fruit (raisins, dates, apricots, peaches, etc.) Beat all the ingredients together in a large bowl.

One-pot meals in a dutch oven or iron kettle over a fire are still a practical method for preparing a lot of food with minimum effort. For casseroles the ingredients are mixed together in the cooking vessel and then baked. For soups and stews on the stove top or over the fire, the meat goes in first and vegetables are added towards the end of the cooking time. If unexpected guests show up, an extra potato can be quartered and dropped in the stew pot. If meat is in short supply for your stew, you can substitute bouillon cubes and a little butter or vegetable oil and add potatoes or dumplings. Dumplings can be quickly prepared to stretch a meal by adding biscuit dough in small lumps or strips and steaming in the covered pot for 10 to 15 minutes (either use a biscuit recipe from the previous section or try one of the dumpling recipes below). Whole Wheat Biscuit Mix for Dumplings 1 cup white flour 1 cup whole wheat flour 2 tsp. baking powder 1 tsp. salt 2 tbsp. shortening or oil 1/4 cup powdered milk Combine at home and store in a zip-lock bag or Nalgene bottle.

This is fine to provide energy for a long hike or to allow you to sleep warmly. The carbohydrates in simple sugars are more easily assimilated by the body (about fifteen minutes). Cookies or breads containing fruit and a high sugar content make good snacks for a quick pick- me-up on the trail. For example, most of recipes in the cornbread section can be prepared using a little extra brown sugar, molasses and some raisins. Cooking the sugar rich cornbread batter in a cast iron corn stick pan makes an excellent trail snack or something to munch on in a sniper hide. To satisfy your sweet tooth and to provide quick energy, here are some recipes that use sugar (brown sugar is easier to carry and use in the field), molasses and dried or fresh fruits (there is a possibility that you might just happen to run across a couple of apples in Washington State): Yankee Cake 2 cups brown sugar 2 tbsp. shortening 2 cups hot water 1 package seedless raisins 3 cups flour 1 tsp. salt 1 tsp. baking soda 1 tsp. cinnamon 1 tsp. cloves Combine and boil the sugar, water, shortening, raisins, salt and spices for 5 minutes.

It\\'s also a culinary taboo to eat vermin like rats and groundhogs, but many people eat other rodents like rabbits and squirrels. Cultural culinary taboos have nothing to do with nutrition and if you can \"unlearn\" them a wide variety of new potential protein sources is available to you. If you have trapped a nice juicy rat or if Fido and Tabby aren\\'t performing a vital task like protecting your food larder, garden or hen house you may find the recipes in this section of interest.

In the stomach cavity (which should be patted with salt and pepper) place the peeled oranges, peeled garlic cloves and aromatics. Tie the cavity closed or pin closed with little wooden skewers, threaded in and out of the soft belly skin. Coat the whole animal with clay. Do several coats so you have a good shell formed. Put in a hole with hot coals at the bottom and pile hot coals on top of the clay cat. Throw a blanket of banana leaves (or other green vegetation) over the hole. Let bake for 2 or 3 hours while you are tending to other things. The fur will come off when you strip the clay away. Baked Dog DiRocco 1 small dog 10 bay leaves or any aromatic spice 1 onion 1 pod hot red pepper 1 GI mess kit spoon salt black pepper 3 slices bacon Mike DiRocco, who served three tours in Vietnam, offers a good tip on selecting the best dog for cooking. He says the Vietnamese judge how tender the dog will be by color; a white dog is best, brown second best and lastly a black dog. Skin and clean dog. Remove the glands from under the legs (they have a strong taste, though they are not harmful if eaten). Cut into sections. Put pieces in a pot. Add bay leaves or aromatics, then onion, red pepper and salt. Cover with cold water. Cover pot and boil gently for 30 minutes. Drain meat and discard water and seasonings. Cover again with cold water and boil for 1 hour. Again pour out the water and drain. Cover dog with cold water for a third time and cover pot. Boil gently until tender, about 1 hour. Drain. Put dog in pan. Season with plenty of black pepper and salt if needed. Cover with slices of bacon or fat pork. Put in a clay oven or a covered pan placed in hot coals and covered with coals. Bake for 1- 1/2 hours. Make gravy with pan juices. \"Militia Cookbook\" Emergency Food Preparation Page 35 of 37 Barbecued Dog Dress dog, removing any glands from under the legs.

They could be anywhere— at work at school or in the car. How will you find each other? Will you know if your children are safe? Disaster can strike quickly and without warning. It can force you to evacuate your neighborhood or confine you to your home. What would you do if basic services–water, gas, electricity or telephones–were cut off? Local officials and relief workers will be on the scene after a disaster, but they cannot reach everyone right away. Families can–and do–cope with disaster by preparing in advance and working together as a team. Follow the steps listed in this brochure to create your family’s disaster plan. Knowing what to do is your best protection and your responsibility. Your Family Disaster Plan (name) outside your neighborhood 4 Steps to Safety Fill out, copy and distribute to all family members Locate the main electric fuse box, water service main and natural gas main. Learn how and when to turn these utilities off. Teach all responsible family members. Keep necessary tools near gas and water shut-off valves. Remember, turn off the utilities only if you suspect the lines are damaged or if you are instructed to do so. If you turn the gas off, you will need a professional to turn it back on. UTILITIES EMERGENCY SUPPLIES Keep enough supplies in your home to meet your needs for at least three days. Assemble a Disaster Supplies Kit with items you may need in an evacua- tion. Store these supplies in sturdy, easy-to-carry containers such as back- packs, duffle bags or covered trash containers. Include: A three-day supply of water (one gallon per person per day) and food that won’t spoil. One change of clothing and foot- wear per person, and one blanket or sleeping bag per person. A first aid kit that includes your family’s prescription medications. Emergency tools including a bat- tery-powered radio, flashlight and plenty of extra batteries. An extra set of car keys and a credit card, cash or traveler’s checks. Sanitation supplies. Special items for infant, elderly or disabled family members. An extra pair of glasses. Keep important family documents in a waterproof container. Keep a smaller kit in the trunk of your car. 2 Create a Disaster Plan Meet with your family and discuss why you need to prepare for disaster. Explain the dangers of fire, severe weather and earthquakes to children. Plan to share responsibili- ties and work together as a team. Discuss the types of disasters that are most likely to happen. Explain what to do in each case. Pick two places to meet: 1. Right outside your home in case of a sudden emergency, like a fire. 2. Outside your neighborhood in case you can’t return home. Everyone must know the address and phone number. Ask an out-of-state friend to be your “family contact.” After a disaster, it’s often easier to call long distance. Other family members should call this person and tell them where they are. Everyone must know your contact’s phone number. Discuss what to do in an evacuation. Plan how to take care of your pets. Find Out What Could Happen to You Contact your local emergency management or civil defense office and American Red Cross chapter — be prepared to take notes: Ask what types of disasters are most likely to happen. Request infor- mation on how to prepare for each. Learn about your community’s warning signals: what they sound like and what you should do when you hear them. Ask about animal care after disaster. Animals may not be allowed inside emergency shelters due to health regulations. Find out how to help elderly or disabled persons, if needed. Next, find out about the disaster plans at your workplace, your children’s school or daycare center and other places where your family spends time. 41 Family Disaster Plan outside your home day evening Emergency Meeting Place Meeting Place Phone Address Family Contact Phone ( ) Phone ( ) 3 HOME HAZARD HUNT During a disaster, ordinary objects in your home can cause injury or damage. Anything that can move, fall, break or cause a fire is a home hazard. For example, a hot water heater or a bookshelf can fall. Inspect your home at least once a year and fix potential hazards. Contact your local fire department to learn about home fire hazards. Test your smoke detectors monthly and change the batteries at least once a year. Jan. July Feb. Aug. Mar. Sep. Apr. Oct. May Nov. June Dec. Change batteries in each year. (month) Working with neighbors can save lives and property. Meet with your neighbors to plan how the neighborhood could work together after a disas- ter until help arrives. If you’re a member of a neighborhood organization, such as a home association or crime watch group, introduce disaster pre- paredness as a new activity. Know your neighbors’ special skills (e.g., medical, technical) and consider how you could help neighbors who have special needs, such as disabled and elderly persons. Make plans for child care in case parents can’t get home. NEIGHBORS HELPING NEIGHBORS Quiz your kids every six months so they remember what to do. Conduct fire and emergency evacuation drills. Year Drill Date Replace stored water every three months and stored food every six months. Test and recharge your fire extinguisher(s) according to manufacturer’s instructions. 4 Practice and Maintain Your Plan Evacuate immediately if told to do so: Listen to your battery-powered radio and follow the instructions of local emergency officials. Wear protective clothing and sturdy shoes. Take your Disaster Supplies Kit. Lock your home. Use travel routes specified by local authorities — don’t use shortcuts because certain areas may be impassable or dangerous. If you’re sure you have time: Shut off water, gas and electricity before leaving, if instructed to do so. Post a note telling others when you left and where you are going. Make arrangements for your pets. EVACUATION Post emergency telephone numbers by phones (fire, police, ambulance, etc.). Teach children how and when to call 911 or your local Emergency Medical Services number for emergency help. Show each family member how and when to turn off the water, gas and electricity at the main switches. Check if you have adequate insurance coverage. Teach each family member how to use the fire extinguisher (ABC type), and show them where it’s kept. Complete This Checklist Install smoke detectors on each level of your home, especially near bedrooms. Conduct a home hazard hunt. Stock emergency supplies and assemble a Disaster Supplies Kit. Take a Red Cross first aid and CPR class. Determine the best escape routes from your home. Find two ways out of each room. Find the safe spots in your home for each type of disaster. IF DISASTER STRIKES If disaster strikes Remain calm and patient. Put your plan into action. Check for injuries Give first aid and get help for seri- ously injured people. Listen to your battery powered radio for news and instructions Evacuate, if advised to do so. Wear protective clothing and sturdy shoes. bleaches, gasoline and other flammable liquids immediately. Check for damage in your home. . . Use flashlights — do not light matches or turn on electrical switches, if you suspect damage. Check for fires, fire hazards and other household hazards. Sniff for gas leaks, starting at the water heater. If you smell gas or suspect a leak, turn off the main gas valve, open windows, and get everyone outside quickly. Shut off any other damaged utilities.

POU ee eee ala ete RS Ree ree WET ey REtHEDINEONay Management Agency Your Family BUCS (a ma --- Content from Copy of Emergency Preparedness for Childbirth --- Unexpected events—such as earthquakes, fl oods, and terrorist attacks—can cause widespread problems. Although these situations are rare, you can plan for labor and birth at home if a disaster prevents you from getting to a hospital or birth center. Birth has occurred in homes for centuries and can be very safe if you are prepared. Call for Help Keep an up-to-date contact list of anyone who may be able to come to help you with the birth. Keep the fam- ily car fi lled with gas if you are getting close to your due date. If you do go into labor during a disaster, fi rst try to reach your midwife, doctor, or hospital. If you can’t reach your health care provider, call 911. If you have telephone service, a health care provider or 911 operator can ‘talk you through’ labor and birth. Prepare the Room Cover the bed with a shower curtain and then place a clean sheet over the shower curtain so you keep the mattress from getting wet. Have your front door unlocked so that rescue workers can get into your home. Get your kit of supplies out and have it open by your bed. Th e other side of this handout lists the steps your helper will take if you do not have a health care provider available when you give birth.

Help keep the mom comfortable. Place some towels under her to catch fl uid when the bag of waters breaks and for vaginal bleeding that can occur during labor. Th e fi rst stage of labor can last from a few hours to several hours. Once the mother starts grunting or pushing, the fi rst stage is over, and the baby will be born soon. Th e pushing stage can last for just a few minutes but may last an hour or 2 if this is the mother’s fi rst baby. Instructions for Your Helper During the Birth When you start to see the head at the opening to the vagina, put on sterile gloves. If you don’t have gloves, wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water or use hand sanitizer. 1. As soon as the head is out, feel around the head to see if the cord is around the baby’s neck. Th e cord is slippery, round, and feels jelly-like. 2. If the cord is around the neck, gently lift it over the head or push it back behind the shoulders. 3. If the shoulders do not come out immediately: Gently push the side of the baby’s head toward the mother’s back to help the shoulders come out and ask her to push. Once the shoulders are out, the rest of the body will come quickly. 4. If the shoulders still do not come out: Have the mom lie on her back and pull her knees up toward her chest, then ask her to push. Th is helps move her pelvis up and over the shoulders if they are stuck. Instructions for Your Helper with the New Baby 1. When the baby is born, place the baby on the mother’s bare chest and cover both of them with a blanket. Remove the fi rst wet towel and keep them covered with dry blankets. Place a hat on the baby. 2. If the baby is not crying or breathing easily: Rub the baby’s back up and down fi rmly. Do not spank or hold the baby upside down. 3. If the baby is still not crying or breathing easily: Turn the baby so he/she is looking up at the ceiling and tilt his/her head back to straighten the airway, and keep rubbing the back. Once the baby is breathing easily, he/she will turn pink. Th e baby’s hands and feet will remain bluish for a few hours. 4. If the baby is gagging or turning blue: Use the bulb syringe to clear fl uid from the nose and mouth. If the baby is still not breathing, start infant CPR. 5. Tie the umbilical cord in 2 places close together about 3 inches from the baby with the white shoestrings. Use a double knot for each. Cut the umbilical cord between the 2 tied-off sections with sterile scissors. Th ere is no hurry to do this. Th e baby will do best if you wait until you cannot feel a pulse when you hold the umbilical cord between your fi ngers. Instructions for Your Helper with the Placenta 1. Th e placenta will be ready to come out within a few minutes to about 30 minutes aft er the birth. You may see a gush of blood and the umbilical cord get longer when the placenta is ready to deliver. Place the bowl next to the mother’s vagina and ask her to push out the placenta. It will come out with some bleeding and fl uid. Put the placenta in plastic bags. 2. As soon as the placenta is out, the mother’s bleeding will be like bleeding from a heavy period. Getting the baby to breastfeed is very important, because it will slow down the bleeding aft er birth.

Ready asks individuals to do three key things: get an emergency supply kit, make a family emergency plan, and be informed about the different types of emergencies that could occur and their appropriate responses. All Americans should have some basic supplies on hand in order to survive for at least three days if an emergency occurs. Following is a listing of some basic items that every emergency supply kit should include. However, it is important that individuals review this list and consider where they live and the unique needs of their family in order to create an emergency supply kit that will meet these needs. Individuals should also consider having at least two emergency supply kits, one full kit at home and smaller portable kits in their workplace, vehicle or other places they spend time. Federal Emergency Management Agency Washington, DC 20472 q q q q q q q q q q q --- Content from Copy of FEMA Facts on House and Building Fires --- F A C T S H E E T HOUSE AND BUILDING FIRES A fire can engulf a structure in a matter of minutes. Understanding the basic characteristics of fire and learning the proper safety practices can be the key to surviving a house or building fire. Federal Emergency Management Agency Install smoke detectors. Check them once a month and change the batteries at least once a year. Develop and practice an escape plan. Make sure all family members know what to do in a fire. I Draw a floor plan with at least two ways of escaping every room. Choose a safe meeting place outside the house. I Practice alerting other household members. It is a good idea to keep a bell and a flashlight in each bedroom for this purpose. I Practice evacuating the building blindfolded. In a real fire situation, the amount of smoke generated by a fire will most likely make it impos- sible to see. I Practice staying low to the ground when escaping. I Feel all doors before opening them. If the door is hot, get out another way. I Learn to stop, drop to the ground, and roll if clothes catch fire. Post emergency numbers near telephones. However, be aware that if a fire threatens your home, you should not place the call to your emer- gency services from inside the home. It is better to get out first and place the call from some- where else. Purchase collapsible ladders at hardware stores and practice using them. Install A-B-C type fire extin- guishers in the home and teach family members how to use them. Do not store combustible materials in closed areas or near a heat source. Keep the stove area clean and clear of combustibles such as bags, boxes, and other appliances. If a fire starts, put a lid over the burning pan or use a fire extinguisher. Be careful. Moving the pan can cause the fire to spread. Never pour water on grease fires. Cooking Check electrical wiring. I Replace wiring if frayed or cracked. I Make sure wiring is not under rugs, over nails, or in high traffic areas. I Do not overload outlets or extension cords. I Outlets should have cover plates and no exposed wiring. I Only purchase appliances and electrical devices that have a label indicating that they have been inspected by a testing laboratory such as Under Laboratories (UL) or Factory Mutual (FM). Contact your local fire depart- ment or American Red Cross chapter for more information on fire safety. EMERGENCY PUBLIC INFORMATION Give first aid where appropriate. Seriously injured or burned victims should be transported to professional medical help immediately. Stay out of damaged buildings. Return home only when local fire authorities say it is safe. Look for structural damage. Check that all wiring and utilities are safe. Discard food that has been exposed to heat, smoke, or soot. Contact insurance agent. Don’t discard damaged goods until after an inventory has been taken. Save receipts for money spent relating to fire loss. Smoke detectors more than double the chance of surviving a fire. Smoke detectors sense abnormal amounts of smoke or invisible combustion gases in the air. They can detect both smouldering and burning fires. At least one smoke detector should be installed on every level of a structure. Test the smoke detectors each month and replace the batteries at least once a year. Purchase smoke detectors labeled by the Underwriter’s Laboratories (UL) or Factory Mutual (FM). Smoke Detectors Get out as quickly and as safely as possible. Use the stairs to escape. When evacuating, stay low to the ground. If possible, cover mouth with a cloth to avoid inhaling smoke and gases. Close doors in each room after escaping to delay the spread of the fire. If in a room with a closed door. I If smoke is pouring in around the bottom of the door or it feels hot, keep the door closed. I Open a window to escape or for fresh air while awaiting rescue. I If there is no smoke at the bottom or top and the door is not hot, then open the door slowly. I If there is too much smoke or fire in the hall, slam the door shut. Call the fire department from a location outside the house. September 1993 Heating devices such as portable heaters, wood stoves, and fireplaces demand safe operation. Use portable heaters in well-ventilated rooms only. Refuel kerosene heaters outdoors only. Have chimneys and wood stoves cleaned annually. Buy only approved heaters and follow the manufacturer’s directions. Heating Devices B A C K G R O U N D E R WHAT IS A FIRE? HOUSE AND BUILDING FIRES Fire is the fourth largest accidental killer in the United States, behind motor vehicle accidents, falls, and drownings. It is also the disaster that families are mostly likely to experience. Over 80 percent of all fire deaths occur where people sleep, such as in homes or hotels. Most fires occur when people are likely to be less alert such as between midnight and morning. Eighty-four percent of house and building fires are accidental, such as those caused by poor electrical wiring or careless behavior. However, 16 percent are set intentionally through arson or acts of terrorism. 1. The leading cause of death in a fire is asphyxiation. Fire victims seldom see the flames. Fire consumes the oxygen in the air, thereby increasing the concentration of deadly car- bon monoxide in the atmosphere. Inhaling carbon monox- ide causes a loss of consciousness or death within minutes. 2. The heat from a fire can melt clothes and scorch the lungs in a single breath. At floor level, temperatures average about 90 degrees Fahrenheit, but at eye level rise to 600 degrees. 3. House fires begin with a bright flame then quickly gen- erate a black, choking smoke. It is nearly impossible to see through a thick cloud of smoke, so fire drill participants should practice evacuating buildings with their eyes closed. EMERGENCY INFORMATION Accidental fire and explosion can strike anywhere. Fire fatalities tend to be distributed according to population density, i.e., those states with the largest populations tend also to have the greatest number of fire fatalities.

Highlight the importance of home smoke detectors by running monthly “battery-check reminders.” The media can raise awareness about fire safety by providing important information to the community. Here are some suggestions: CAUSE OF HOME FIRE DEATHS HELP YOUR COMMUNITY GET READY D I D Y O U K N O W . . . I Loss of life from fires has been significantly reduced because of improved technology for fire response and a better educated public — particularly regarding the life-saving advantages of using and maintaining smoke detectors. The United States Fire Admin- istration reports a 5.9 percent reduction in deaths attributable to fires over the period of 1983 to 1990. I On average, fires kill nearly 5,500 Americans each year. Over 30,000 people are injured in fires annually. I In the United States, someone dies in a fire every 40 minutes. Most often, victims are chil- dren or the elderly. I Nearly 25 percent of the fires that kill young children are started by children playing with fire. Approximately 1,300 senior citizens die in fires annually. I Approximately three-quarters of all fire fatalities occur in residential dwellings. I Each year, fire causes over $2 billion worth of damage to homes.

Learning the hurricane warning messages and planning ahead can reduce the chances of injury or major property damage. Plan an evacuation route. Contact the local emergency management office or American Red Cross chapter, and ask for the community hurricane preparedness plan. This plan should include information on the safest evacua- tion routes and nearby shelters. Learn safe routes inland. Be ready to drive 20 to 50 miles inland to locate a safe place. Have disaster supplies on hand. Flashlight and extra batteries Portable, battery-operated radio and extra batteries First aid kit and manual Emergency food and water Nonelectric can opener Essential medicines Cash and credit cards Sturdy shoes Make arrangements for pets. Pets may not be allowed into emergency shelters for health and space reasons. Contact your local humane society for information on local animal shelters. Make sure that all family members know how to re- spond after a hurricane. Teach family members how and when to turn off gas, electricity, and water. Teach children how and when to call 9-1-1, police, or fire department and which radio station to tune to for emergency information. Protect your windows. Permanent shutters are the best protection. A lower-cost approach is to put up plywood panels. Use 1/ 2 inch plywood— marine plywood is best—cut to fit each window. Remember to mark which board fits which window. Pre-drill holes every 18 inches for screws. Do this long before the storm. Trim back dead or weak branches from trees. Check into flood insurance. You can find out about the National Flood Insurance Program through your local insurance agent or emergency management office. There is normally a 5-day waiting period before a new policy becomes effective. Homeowners policies do not cover damage from the flooding that accompanies a hurricane. Develop an emergency communication plan. In case family members are sepa- rated from one another during a disaster (this is a real possibility during the day when adults are at work and children are at school), have a plan for getting back together. Federal Emergency Management Agency Ask an out-of-state relative or friend to serve as the “family contact.” After a disaster, it’s often easier to call long distance. Make sure everyone in the family knows the name, address, and phone number of the contact person. Hurricane Watches and Warnings A hurricane watch is issued when there is a threat of hurricane conditions within 24-36 hours. A hurricane warning is issued when hurricane conditions (winds of 74 miles per hour or greater, or dangerously high water and rough seas) are expected in 24 hours or less. DURING A HURRICANE WATCH I Listen to a battery-operated radio or television for hurricane progress reports. I Check emergency supplies. I Fuel car. I Bring in outdoor objects such as lawn furniture, toys, and garden tools, and anchor objects that cannot be brought inside. I Secure buildings by closing and boarding up windows. Remove outside antennas. I Turn refrigerator and freezer to coldest settings. Open only when absolutely necessary and close quickly. I Store drinking water in clean bathtubs, jugs, bottles, and cooking utensils. I Review evacuation plan. I Moor boat securely or move it to a designated safe place. Use rope or chain to secure boat to trailer. Use tie-downs to anchor trailer to the ground or house. DURING A HURRICANE WARNING I Listen constantly to a battery- operated radio or television for official instructions. I If in a mobile home, check tie- downs and evacuate immediately. I Store valuables and personal papers in a waterproof container on the highest level of your home. I Avoid elevators. If at home: I Stay inside, away from windows, skylights, and glass doors. I Keep a supply of flashlights and extra batteries handy. Avoid open flames, such as candles and kerosene lamps, as a source of light. I If power is lost, turn off major appliances to reduce power “surge” when electricity is restored. If officials indicate evacuation is necessary: I Leave as soon as possible. Avoid flooded roads and watch for washed-out bridges. I Secure your home by unplugging appliances and turning off electricity and the main water valve. I Tell someone outside of the storm area where you are going. EMERGENCY PUBLIC INFORMATION September 1993 I If time permits, and you live in an identified surge zone, elevate furniture to protect it from flood- ing or better yet, move it to a higher floor. I Bring pre-assembled emergency supplies and warm protective clothing. I Take blankets and sleeping bags to shelter. I Lock up home and leave. Stay tuned to local radio for information. Help injured or trapped persons. I Give first aid where appropriate. I Do not move seriously injured persons unless they are in immedi- ate danger of further injury. Call for help. Return home only after authorities advise that it is safe to do so. I Avoid loose or dangling power lines and report them immediately to the power company, police, or fire department. I Enter your home with caution. I Beware of snakes, insects, or animals driven to higher ground by flood water. I Open windows and doors to ventilate and dry your home. I Check refrigerated foods for spoilage. I Take pictures of the damage, both to the house and its contents and for insurance claims. Drive only if absolutely necessary and avoid flooded roads and washed-out bridges. Mitigation Mitigation includes any activities that prevent an emergency, reduce the chance of an emergency happening, or lessen the damaging effects of unavoid- able emergencies. Investing in preventive mitigation steps now such as strengthening unreinforced masonry to withstand wind and flooding and installing shutters on every window will help reduce the impact of hurricanes in the future. For more information on mitigation, contact your local emergency management office. Check for gas leaks — If you smell gas or hear a blowing or hissing noise, open a window and quickly leave the building. Turn off the gas at the outside main valve if you can and call the gas company from a neighbor’s home. If you turn off the gas for any reason, it must be turned back on by a professional. Look for electrical system damage — If you see sparks or broken or frayed wires, or if you smell hot insulation, turn off the electricity at the main fuse box or circuit breaker. If you have to step in water to get to the fuse box or circuit breaker, call an electrician first for advice. Check for sewage and water lines damage — If you suspect sewage lines are damaged, avoid using the toilets and call a plumber. If water pipes are damaged, contact the water company and avoid using water from the tap. You can obtain safe water by melting ice cubes. Inspecting Utilities in a Damaged Home Use telephone only for emer- gency calls. 1. The 74 to 160 mile per hour winds of a hurricane can extend inland for hundreds of miles. Hurricanes can spawn tornadoes, which add to the destructiveness of the storm. Floods and flash floods generated by torrential rains also cause damage and loss of life. Following a hurricane, inland streams and rivers can flood and trigger landslides. 2. When a hurricane watch is issued, the best response is to protect your property by boarding up windows, bringing in outside items, and being prepared to evacuate the area as soon as officials so advise. 3. Even more dangerous than the high winds of a hurricane is the storm surge—a dome of ocean water that can be 20 feet high at its peak and 50 to 100 miles wide. The surge can devastate coastal communities as it sweeps ashore. Nine out of 10 hurricane fatalities are attributable to the storm surge. EMERGENCY INFORMATION Areas in the United States vulnerable to hurricanes include the Atlantic and Gulf coasts from Texas to Maine, the territories in the Caribbean, and tropical areas of the western Pacific, H U R R I C A N E S WHAT IS A HURRICANE? A hurricane is a tropical storm with winds that have reached a constant speed of 74 miles per hour or more. Hurricane winds blow in a large spiral around a relatively calm center known as the “eye.” The “eye” is generally 20 to 30 miles wide, and the storm may extend outward 400 miles. As a hurricane approaches, the skies will begin to darken and winds will grow in strength. As a hurricane nears land, it can bring torrential rains, high winds, and storm surges. A single hurricane can last for more than 2 weeks over open waters and can run a path across the entire length of the eastern seaboard. August and September are peak months during the hurricane season, that lasts from June 1 ut ME s- 20 Times ere eee eerie ean ee the 2 Lee eee eerie ean ee When disaster strikes, people everywhere want to help those in need. To en- sure that this compassion and generosity are put to good use, the media can highlight these facts: Financial aid is the immediate need of disaster victims. Financial contributions should be made through a recognized voluntary organization to help ensure that contributions are put to their intended use. At some point local officials may ask for donations of clothing. However, immediately after a disaster, relief workers usually don’t have the time or facilities to setup distributions channels, and too often these items go to waste. Before sending food donations, wait for instructions from local officials. If officials ask for food, baby food is needed first, then ready-to-eat, non- perishable items. Volunteers should go through a recognized voluntary agency such as the American Red Cross or Salvation Army. They know what is needed and are prepared to deal with the need. Local emergency services directors also coordinate all kinds of volunteer efforts. Organizations wishing to donate items should first contact local officials to find out what is needed. Be prepared to deliver the items to one place, tell officials when you’ll be there, and provide for transportation, driver, and unloading. HOW THE PUBLIC CAN HELP AFTER A DISASTER I In less than a 4 week period in 1992, two major hurricanes hit the United States leaving an unprecedented array of devasta- tion. First Hurricane Andrew pounded parts of Florida and Louisiana to become the most expensive natural disaster in U.S. history with damage estimates in the range of $15 billion to $30 billion. Then 3 weeks later, Hurricane Iniki affected three Hawaiian islands resulting in over $1 billion in damage, particularly on Kauai. I Eighteen of the 54 direct deaths attributed to Hurricane Andrew occurred during the recovery phase. Of those identified, eight were stress-induced heart attacks, three were either people falling in damaged buildings or D I D Y O U K N O W . . . hit by debris while cleaning up, and two were children who died in fires in damaged homes. I On the average, 10 tropical cyclones develop in the North Atlantic each year. Of these, six may strengthen to hurricane proportion, of which two are likely to strike the coast of the United States. I Hurricane winds in the northern hemisphere circulate in a coun- terclockwise motion around the hurricane’s center or “eye,” while hurricane winds in the southern hemisphere circulate clockwise. I The Galveston, Texas, hurricane in 1900 was the natural disaster that resulted in the most deaths in United States history. This hurricane took 6,000 lives. The media can raise awareness about hurricanes by providing important information to the community. Here are some suggestions: 1. Publish a special section in your local newspaper with emergency information on hurricanes. Localize the informa- tion by printing the phone numbers of local emergency services offices, the American Red Cross, and hospitals. 2. Provide hurricane tracking charts to local schools. 3. Work with local emergency services and American Red Cross officials to prepare special reports for people with mobility impairments on what to do if an evacuation is ordered. 4. Stage a simulated evacuation to show your community what can happen. 5. Periodically inform your community of local public warning systems.

But every so often our routines change drastically due to accidents or other conditions. These are the times that make us realize how fragile our lives are, or can be. Emergencies, disasters, accidents and injuries can occur any time and without warning. Being prepared to handle emergencies is an individual as well as a family responsibility. Emergency planning procedures should cover your home, work, and recreation place. These procedures will help reduce the effects of disasters and emergencies and could even save someone\\'s life. Your safety, as well as the safety of your family, friends and co-workers, is of primary importance. The purpose of this guide is to provide self-help information and disaster safety guidelines for you to use during times of disasters, emergencies, or catastrophic events. In a major disaster or catastrophe, local government may be severely affected and may have to recover before it can provide basic services to the public. This action could take some time. During this period the citizens of the community must be able to function without government assistance. If you are handicapped, contact your closest relative or neighbour for help during an emergency situation. Please study this guide and share it with family members and co-workers. Know the do\\'s and don\\'ts before a disaster strikes. Then keep this material readily available. The better you are prepared, the better you are able to respond and reduce panic or confusion when a disaster strikes. No matter what the crisis: THINK BEFORE YOU REACT, THEN MOVE QUICKLY TO REDUCE YOUR RISK TO DANGER.

Review it at the beginning of each season. It is important to gain a basic awareness of health and safety procedures as well as the following: Become familiar with the safety guidelines at your work-place as well as at home. Know where the fire extinguisher is located. Be familiar with any information that will help you act quickly. Know where your home emergency supplies are located. Keep important and valuable papers in a fire and waterproof container. Keep on hand any personal items and clothing you may need during an emergency, or in the event it becomes necessary to evacuate your home. Know what medications you or your family are taking. Keep food items in stock that do not require cooking. Learn First Aid and CPR. Keep books, games and toys available to occupy time and entertain children. Although the information contained in this pamphlet is not all inclusive, it does cover most actions that should be taken during emergencies. Every situation is unique. Common sense must prevail when instructions are not available or do not fit the situation. Listen to the radio or television for additional information and instructions from local officials. Conduct drills and exercises to test your plan to make certain the plan will work and is current. Prepare your family so they can cope with the situation until you get on the scene (home, office, etc.). Remain calm and think before you act.

Once you have learned the safety guidelines in this pamphlet, chances are you will not have to learn a new set for many years to come. But, frequent review is important. Watches and Warnings - Know the Difference The definitions for WATCH and WARNING are the same whether it is for a man-made or natural disaster. A WATCH simply means that conditions are favourable for an emergency or severe weather to occur within the defined area. The WATCH area could be just your municipality or it could include surrounding municipalities as well. A WARNING means that somewhere within the area an emergency or severe weather is taking place. STAY ALERT. You should pay attention to both WATCHES and WARNINGS so you can warn your family, friends or co-workers that a dangerous situation could occur or is occurring. Safety Information Know where to turn off gas, water and electricity. During and following any disaster large or small, be alert to downed power lines and the smell of gas. Turn power off at the circuit breaker and gas at the meter. Know the difference between a WATCH and a WARNING. Listen to the radio or television for official information. Follow only instructions given by officials. Exercise your plan, make necessary changes and discuss it with family members. Identify a place where your family members will meet during an emergency. Safety Equipment Get smoke detectors for your home. Replace the batteries as necessary. Have a portable radio that can run on both AC and battery power. Have a flashlight and extra batteries. It would be a good idea for the flashlight and radio to use the same size batteries. Get a First Aid Kit. Get a tone-activated weather radio. 2 Severe Weather Tornadoes Danger signs for tornadoes include severe thunderstorms in the area with strong, gusty winds, and a funnel or dark column spinning from the sky to the ground. You will often hear a loud, roaring noise similar to the noise of a train or an airplane. Any time there are severe thunderstorms in the area, you should stay alert for tornado WATCHES or WARNINGS to be issued by Environment Canada. Tornadoes can travel in excess of speeds of 100 kilometres per hour but average 50 kilometres per hour. The average width of a tornado is about 90 to 120 metres at the ground. The average length is less than a kilometre but has exceeded 65 kilometres. Tornadoes generally occur between the hours of 3:00 p.m. and 7:00 p.m. and about 85 per cent will come from a southwest direction. If you are home If you have a basement, go there and protect your head and face. If you do not have a basement, go the the centre part of your house on the lowest level. A closet or bathroom is usually a good place to seek shelter. Always protect your head and chest from flying objects. If you are in a high-rise building DO NOT use an elevator. Go to the centre of the building, stairwells, or to a rest room. Follow the directions of building security or officials. If you are in a vehicle STOP! Get out of the vehicle and move away from the tornado\\'s path at a right angle and lie in a hollow or ditch. Remember to cover your head and chest. If a tornado strikes DO NOT stay in mobile homes...get out and seek shelter elsewhere. View a mobile home as a vehicle. DO NOT try to outrun the tornado in your vehicle or on foot...you could lose the race and your life. DO NOT open windows. DO NOT stay in large open rooms. DO NOT stay in areas that have a lot of windows. 3 Lightning At any given time there are over 2,000 thunderstorms in progress over the surface of the earth. Lightning strikes the earth over 100 times each second and can be very dangerous. Keep the following precautions in mind to avoid injury. Stay inside. DO NOT go out unless absolutely necessary. Stay away from open doors, windows, telephones, plumbing fixtures, metal objects and chimneys. Disconnect sensitive electronic devices and electrical appliances. If you are outdoors Seek shelter in a building, hollow or ditch. If shelter is unavailable, kneel on the ground and lean forward with your head lower than your back (but not touching the ground) and place your hands on your thighs. Avoid hilltops, tall trees, open spaces, and metal objects such as fences, machinery, sheds, etc. DO NOT use or handle metal items such as tools, umbrellas, golf clubs, etc. DO NOT go swimming or boating. If you are in a vehicle Stay in your vehicle. DO NOT touch metal surfaces inside the vehicle. DO NOT park near trees or other high objects. First Aid If you see someone struck by lightning, call an ambulance immediately. Administer first aid such as mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Lightning victims are not \"charged\" and, therefore, not dangerous to touch. 4 Winter Storms Winter weather conditions can become severe or hazardous with little or no warning. Proper preparation plus a knowledge of weather conditions can reduce potential harmful effects to you and your family. Severe winter weather can take a number of forms Blizzards - A combination of falling, drifting snow and high winds with a visibility of less than one km and temperatures below - 10°C. Ice Storms - Freezing rain or drizzle that coats roads, trees and hydro lines causing dangerous driving conditions and power failures. Heavy Snows - Over 10 cm of snow in 12 hours or 15 cm of snow in less than 24 hours. Cold Wave - A rapid drop in temperature of 25°C or more in less than 18 hours. Protective Clothing Wear several layers of loose-fitting, light-weight clothing. This will keep you warmer than a single heavy layer of clothing. The outer garment should be tightly woven and water resistant. Wear mittens, not gloves, for more warmth and protection. Wear a hood or hat. You lose much of your body heat from the head and face area. Travel Precautions The best safety precaution during severe weather conditions is to avoid travelling. However, if you must drive, be prepared. Have your vehicle tuned-up for winter driving and keep your vehicle full of fuel. Plan your trips in advance and drive on well-travelled roads. If you plan to go on a trip, tell family or friends of your route, the time you leave or the time you expect to be at your destination. Listen to the radio for weather updates. If driving conditions become serious, turn back or stop on the side of the road. Carry a winter survival kit. Stranded Travellers If you get trapped in your vehicle, stay with the vehicle, DO NOT panic and remember the following: Avoid exposure and overexertion. Check the exhaust pipe to ensure it is not blocked with snow. Keep a window partially opened. Run the engine sparingly for heat. Avoid overuse of headlights as they will wear down the battery. Use the interior dome light sparingly at night, as an emergency signal. 5 Exercise by moving your arms and legs. DO NOT let all occupants sleep at the same time. Keep watch for searchers and other traffic. Winter Survival Kit Winter survival kits should include the following: Flashlight and extra batteries. Candles and coffee tin. Matches/lighter. Blankets/warm clothing. Granola bars, candy, sugar cubes. First aid kit. Booster cables. Shovel and tow rope. Flares or other signal aids. Home Precautions Severe weather conditions may result in power failures which will affect your home heating system. Anticipate possible heating system failures by preparing these materials in advance. Keep a battery powered radio, flashlight and extra batteries. The radio and flashlight should use the same size batteries. Keep a supply of candles and matches on hand. Keep adequate food stocks and medical supplies on hand. Have a CSA-approved alternate heat source. If you have a stove or fireplace, have the chimney cleaned at least once a year. Check your home fuel supplies such as wood, heating oil, kerosene, etc. DO NOT store liquid fuels in the house. Heating System Failure Precautions If your heating system fails, take these precautions: Stay calm - your house will keep you warm for several hours. Avoid opening doors unnecessarily. During a power failure, turn off all electrical appliances. Begin using your alternate heating unit before the house cools down. If freezing is possible, turn off the main water valve, drain the water lines and put antifreeze in toilet bowl, sink and bath drains. The hot water heater should also be turned off and drained. Check operator manuals of major appliances for frost protection requirements. Listen to the radio for emergency instructions. If You Have Pets Keep extra food/feed on hand. Provide shelter for animals, especially young and small animals or pets. Keep the water source flowing. Most animals die from dehydration because the water source was frozen, not from lack of food. For household pets, keep them inside or in a dry place. 6 Floods Home and property flooding can occur anywhere in Manitoba. Being prepared for a flood can reduce potential harmful effects to your family and property. Flood Warning Action Store fresh drinking water. Regular drinking water supply may become contaminated. Install plugs in basement drains and check sewer backup valves. Remove all chemical products from the basement and other flood prone areas. Move personal belongings to upper floors. Install sump pumps. Contact local municipal authorities before dyking buildings. Contact your Agricultural Representative regarding the relocation of farm produce, livestock, poultry, etc. During Flooding Turn off basement furnaces and the outside gas valve. Turn off electrical power. If the area surrounding the switch is wet, stand on a dry surface and reach with a dry wooden stick. Add 2 1/2 litres of disinfectant (e.g. chlorine bleach) to basement flood waters every two or three days. If you suspect your drinking water is contaminated, purify it by boiling, using purification tablets or chlorinate with a chlorine bleach. Listen on a battery-powered radio for flood instructions. NEVER attempt to cross flood areas on foot or in a vehicle. The water can be swift and you could be swept away. Follow instructions of local officials. Evacuation If you must evacuate remember to take: A flashlight, battery-powered radio, and extra batteries. Waterproof outerwear and footwear. Extra clothing. Essential medicines and toiletries. Personal documents and family identification. 7 Hazardous Materials Accidents Hazardous materials are chemicals that are harmful to humans and to the environment. Accidents can force an evacuation from your home and the surrounding area. Fumes from fire or chemical releases can create problems over a large area. Such accidents are likely to occur in industrial parks, along highways, or along railways. Hazardous materials accidents can be very dangerous because of the possibility of dealing with unknown chemicals. Always be very careful around any chemical accident or chemical spill or fire. What To Do If you see a chemical accident, or notice chemical odours entering your home through windows or the basement, call local fire and police services and the provincial Environmental Accident Reporting Line. Stay upwind of the area. Be careful where you walk. Leave the accident area, move upwind, and help keep others away until officials arrive on the scene. If you are told to evacuate, leave your home or office at once. Check with your neighbours and assist them if necessary. DO NOT take chances. Many chemicals cannot be seen or smelled, but they can be DEADLY. Listen to the radio or television for information and instruction about returning to the area. DO NOT enter the area until a proper assessment has been conducted. You should assist accident victims ONLY if the injury is LIFE THREATENING. 8 Environmental Accident Reporting 24 Hour Emergency Line 1-204-945-4888 Fire Safey Fire can be a killer. DO NOT take chances. The safety guidelines for fire listed below could save lives if you act in a timely manner and STAY CALM. Activate fire alarm to warn others. Call the fire department. Give your name, location of the fire, and other information that would be helpful. Assist your neighbours, people with disabilities, or others who cannot help themselves. Move quickly to your assigned fire exit. Remove high heel shoes to avoid tripping. Use handrails on stairs or ladders. Follow the instructions of building or fire officials. If You Have To Evacuate A Building DO NOT use elevators. Move to your assigned fire exit or evacuation route. Have an alternate evacuation route planned. Get out and away from the building. Go to your assigned location outside the building. Watch for falling glass, wood, or other material. DO NOT try to return to the building. If You Get Trapped In A Room Place cloth material around or under door to prevent smoke from entering. If you can, RETREAT...close as many doors as possible between you and the fire. Be prepared to signal from a window, but do not open or break the window unless absolutely necessary. If you are caught in smoke, drop to your hands and knees and crawl. Hold your breath as much as possible and take shallow breaths through your nose, using a blouse or shirt as a filter. If you have to move through flames to escape, hold your breath and move quickly. Cover your head and hair and keep your head down and eyes closed as much as possible. If your clothes catch on fire ...STOP ...DROP ...ROLL. 9 Fire Extinguisher Instructions Always try to use the appropriate fire extinguisher to put out the fire. Pull safety pin from the handle. Aim the nozzle, cone, or horn at the base of the fire. Squeeze the trigger handle. Sweep from side to side. If the fire is too large, get out of the building or house and move to a safe distance. Home Fire Safety Tips Have a working smoke detector on each level of your home and test it regularly. Change batteries yearly, or as needed. Have a home escape plan and make sure everyone knows what to do and practice it regularly. Know two ways out. Have a meeting place for everyone to go to. Each family member should know how to call the fire department to report a fire, from a neighbour\\'s home. Make sure everyone in your family knows that once they are out they must not go back inside for any reason. 10 First Aid The following information deals with first aid and how to use first aid for various types of injuries. If you do not know first aid, enroll in a class now. You should also learn CPR. You should keep a first aid kit in your car, boat, home, and there should be one at your place of work. Safety Guidelines For Choking If a person is choking, the first question to ask is \"Can you speak?\" If the victim can speak or cry out, the airway is probably open enough to force out the obstructing object. If the victim can speak, or cough: Reassure and encourage coughing. DO NOT hit on back. If victim cannot speak or cough, but is conscious: From behind, wrap your arms around victim\\'s waist. Make fist with one hand, grasp with other hand. Place hands above navel to avoid lower tip of the breastbone. Give one quick inward and upward thrust. Repeat upward thrusts until airway is clear, or victim becomes unconscious. If unconscious, refer to the methods used for resuscitation. If the victim choking is an infant or small child: Support the head and place head lower than trunk; give four back blows. Supporting the head, turn the infant face up. Place two or three fingers on the breastbone between the nipples. Give four chest thrusts. Check mouth for obstruction and remove any visible objects. Give two quick puffs of breath. Repeat above steps until successful. 11 NOTE: This publication is designed as a guide to assist you during emergencies. It is not intended to serve as a substitute for detailed first aid or medical training. It is recommended that all citizens contact their local Red Cross, St. John Ambulance or doctor for additional training or information. Poisoning Be sure there is no further danger to you or the victim. Call for an ambulance immediately, if needed. Try to identify the poison container(s). Keep the container(s) to show the doctor; or read the information when you call the Poison Control Centre number. Be sure you do not become a victim. Move away from the source of poison fumes. Get to fresh air and move the victim to fresh air. If the poison comes in contact with the skin or eyes: Flood the area with cold running water for 15 minutes. Be sure to flush the eyes gently. Remove any contaminated clothing. DO NOT use any chemical antidotes. For Swallowed Household Chemicals or Poisons If the person is conscious, ask questions to find out what type of poison was swallowed. Give milk or water. For an adult, give one to two cups; for a child, give one-half to one cup. Induce vomiting only when advised by the Poison Control Centre or the doctor. Follow instructions of the Poison Control Centre or doctor. To avoid inhalation of vomit, place victim on their side. If the poison is a hydrocarbon or corrosive, DO NOT induce vomiting, but give milk or water. If the person is UNCONSCIOUS: Place person on side. Watch and listen for breathing. Look for movement in chest. DO NOT induce vomiting. Shout at, tap and shake victim. 12 POISON CONTROL CENTRE 24 HOUR NUMBER 1-204-787-2591 (in Winnipeg 9-1-1) Bleeding Serious bleeding occurs with deep cuts and severed blood vessels. Ensure there is no further danger to you or to the victim. Remove clothing to expose extent of wound. Help the victim to lie down or to get comfortable. Cover the wound with sterile cloth. If no dressing is available, use bare hand. Apply firm pressure with your hand directly over the wound. Elevate bleeding part unless bone is broken. When bleeding stops, apply further dressing on top of original dressing and bandage firmly. First Aid Safety Tips For Nose Bleed Seat victim with head tilted forward. Pinch nostrils firmly for ten minutes. Avoid nose blowing. If bleeding persists, call for ambulance or take victim to a doctor. 13 Bone or Joint Injuries There are times that bone or joint injuries will not be visible. Always be careful about moving a victim. If you are unsure, DO NOT move the victim except to prevent further injury. If you suspect that a bone is broken, you can look for signs of swelling or signs that show deformity. Ensure that breathing is normal. Control bleeding by applying direct pressure to wound. DO NOT put pressure directly on broken bones. If you are in doubt, treat the injury as though it is a broken bone. Follow the guidelines below: Immobilize the injured part as much as you can. You can hold the injured limb with your hands or place a pillow, sandbags, clothing, etc. on both sides to keep it in position. For neck or back injuries, stabilize head and neck, and DO NOT move victim until help arrives. To relieve pain, apply cold, NOT heat to bones and joints. If a broken bone or object is protruding through the skin, follow these guidelines: DO NOT remove embedded objects. Apply pressure close to wound, if serious bleeding is present, but DO NOT press on broken bone or protruding object. Place a sterile or clean dressing around the wounded area and cover wound. Maintain pressure and prevent movement of object by applying bulky pads and bandaging in place. 14 Eye Injuries Eye injuries can be very serious. Always use caution and seek professional help as soon as possible. Chemicals in eye Wash eyes immediately with large amounts of fresh cold water for at least 15 minutes. Foreign object in eye Never rub eye and DO NOT try to remove embedded foreign objects. Puncture wounds Puncture wounds to the eye are very serious. Cover both eyes lightly with bandages and seek help as soon as possible. 15 Burns and Scalds Always use caution and make sure there is no further danger to you or the victim. For burns or scalds caused by fire, hot solids, hot liquids or the sun, follow the guidelines below: Cool affected part with cold water and ice to relieve pain. Remove rings and bracelets before swelling begins. Cover wound with clean cloth and secure lightly with bandage. If burn or scald is larger than a dollar coin, seek medical attention immediately. Never breath on, cough on, or touch a burn. Never open blisters. Never apply medications, ointment, or greasy substances to a burned area. Dry or liquid chemical burns Brush off dry chemicals. Flood with running water. Cover with clean dressing and bandage lightly. Electrical burns Before touching victim be sure electricity is turned off. Cover burns with clean dressing and bandage lightly. 16 Cold and Heat Exposure Cold Exposure Cold exposure will cause loss of body heat. Follow the guidelines below: Remove any wet or damp clothing. Wrap in sleeping bag, blankets, or warm and dry clothing. Warm the victim by using your own body heat. Light a fire for warmth, if possible. If the victim is conscious, give warm drinks but NO alcoholic drinks. Heat Exhaustion The cause of heat exhaustion is excessive exposure to heat, with loss of body fluids and subsequent straining of the heart and circulatory system. Treatment: Move victim to a cool or shady area. If the victim is conscious, give fluids to drink, but NO ALCOHOL. If unconscious, keep victim’s airway open and remain with them. Heat Stroke The cause of heat stroke is a high body temperature with the inability to sweat, and poor blood circulation to the brain. This condition is very serious and can cause death. Treatment: Move victim to cool area. Decrease body temperature by sponging the body with cold water and ice. 17 Resuscitation of Victim This area of first aid deals with making sure the victim is breathing, and provides information to assist a victim in breathing until help arrives. If you suspect there is neck injury, DO NOT move the victim. Check the airway to ensure that it is clear. Airway Check (Victim with a Suspected Neck Injury): Steady your hands on the victim’s cheek bones. Grasp the angle of the jaw and, without tilting the head, lift the jaw upward. Airway Check (No Suspected Neck Injury): Place one hand on victim\\'s forehead to tilt the head back. Place fingers of other hand under the chin to lift the jaw. Look for movement in the chest. Listen for breathing. Feel for breath on your cheek. If the person is NOT breathing, start artificial respiration immediately. Adult Resuscitation Keep victim’s head well back (use chin-lift only for suspected neck injuries). Pinch nostrils. Place your mouth over victim\\'s mouth. Give two full breaths. Continue with one breath every five seconds until victim breathes normally or help arrives. If air does not enter victim\\'s chest when attempting artificial respiration, do the following: Reposition the head and attempt again. To clear airway, place heel of one hand on top of back of other hand just above the navel but well below the tip of the breastbone. Press upper abdomen with six to ten quick thrusts. Grasp lower jaw between thumb and finger and lift chin. Insert index finger of other hand deep into mouth and use finger to sweep, dislodge and remove any foreign object. Attempt to give a breath. If unsuccessful, repeat sequence of abdominal thrusts, finger sweeps, and attempts to ventilate until the obstruction is cleared. 18 Feel the pulse in the neck for 10 seconds. If no pulse is felt, start CPR. Use head tilt/chin-lift to open airway. Place heel of one hand on breastbone, above its low tip between nipples. Place heel of other hand on first hand. Press straight down to compress chest one and one-half to two inches (3.8 cm to 5 cm), 100 times per minute. After every fifteen compressions, give two breaths. Continue this action until help arrives. For Small Children (1 to 8 Years of Age) Follow the same procedure as outlined for adults, making the following changes: Use small breaths. Keep airway open. If the airway is obstructed, only remove a foreign object if visualized. Seal mouth and nose properly. Use heel of one hand to perform chest compressions. Compress one to one and one-half inches (2.5 cm to 3.8 cm) about 100 times per minute. After every ten compressions, give one breath. Allow for deflation between breaths. Continue until help arrives. For infants (Under 1 Year of Age) Follow the same procedures outlined for adults, making the following changes: Maintain open airway. Make tight seal over mouth and nose. Use small breaths. If the airway is obstructed, only remove a foreign object if visualized. Place two to three fingers on sternum, one finger\\'s width below the nipple line. Compress down one-half to one inch, (1.3 cm to 2.5 cm) about 100 times per minute. Keep fingers on sternum during upstroke. Complete chest relaxation on upstroke. Allow for deflation between breaths. 19 Emergency Checklist - Discuss with your family and friends how to respond to disaster situations. - Draw a floor plan of your home. Mark two escape routes. - Learn how to turn off water, gas and electricity at your location. - Teach children how and when to use emergency telephone numbers for help (9-1-1 where available). - Pick one out-of-area and one local family member or friend to call if you get separated when you evacuate. - Pick a place and an alternate outside your home to meet in case of fire. - Keep family records and other important papers in a waterproof and fireproof container. - Make arrangements for pets if you leave or evacuate. - Let others know when you leave, where you are going, and when you expect to arrive. Emergency Supplies - An extra set of car keys and house keys. - First aid kit. - Blankets or sleeping bags. - Special items for infants, elderly, or disabled family members. - Special medications necessary for period of evacuation. - Battery-powered radio and extra batteries. - Flashlight and extra batteries. - Tire repair kit and pump. - Flares and an emergency road kit (in your vehicle). - Toys and games for children. - Sewing kit. - Candles and a supply of matches or cigarette lighter. - Non-perishable or canned foods and a manual can opener. 20 Escape Plan In a fire or other emergency, you may need to evacuate your house, apartment or mobile home on a moment\\'s notice. Develop an escape plan by drawing a floor plan of your residence. Using a black pen, show the location of emergency supplies (emergency supplies kit), fire extinguishers, smoke detectors, collapsible ladders, first aid kits and utility shut-off points. Next, use a coloured pen to draw a broken line charting at least two escape routes from each room. Finally, mark a place outside of the home where household members should meet in case of emergency. Be sure to include important points outside such as garages, patios, stairways, elevators, driveways and porches. If your home has more than two floors, use an additional sheet of paper. Practice emergency evacuation drills with all household members at least two times each year.

Koontz I have a strong belief in the importance of family preparedness. In my home we live on our food storage whenever life throws us an unexpected difficulty. We do not think of our storage as only being there in case of some drastic emergency like an earthquake or civic unrest. Using your food storage in your daily life is the only way to be successful in having a complete and efficient supply on hand for whatever you and your family may be called upon to bear. I would be the first to admit that I am, by no means, an expert in this area, but I do have an interest, which has prompted me to research this topic, and I can share ideas and experiences that I have had. I hope this information will be of some use to someone somewhere, and that perhaps it may help families prepare in time. This booklet is in two parts. The first part are some notes, ideas and hints on all aspects of starting, organizing and using your food storage. It is beyond the scope of this work to be complete in all areas on this topic, but is simply a starting place with basic information. The second part is a detailed list of most of the items that should be considered for your storage. I did not simply list each item, but described reasons, uses, advantages or disadvantages about each item. Many item descriptions include information on how best to store them. Please read through the list and the descriptions and decide which are most important to you and your family. If you are just beginning, it may be wise to prioritize what items you intend to store. The list is divided into three sections: Food; Health & Grooming; and Household & Emergency supplies. Many medical and emergency uses are given for various food items, however, if it’s food then it will be listed in the food section, regardless of it’s other uses (medical, emergency, etc.) Each part of the list is listed in alphabetical order. This booklet covers everything from mild to extreme circumstances. When you read through the list you may be tempted to think, Oh, I want so much! I’ll never do it! Well, take heart. Don’t let fear or doubt overwhelm you. Any storage is better than no storage and even the best storage had to start with a single item. Just begin and then build it as you can. You can do it! Should anyone reading this wish to contact me please feel free to contact me via e-mail at debidawn@earthlink.net . I would love to hear from you. If you wish to pass the information in this booklet along, that’s fine, but please keep it complete and intact, with my name attached (for copyright and possible future publication purposes). I appreciate this. So, now, read on and enjoy. I sincerely hope this is of use to you and your loved ones. Part One Comments on Storage and Preparedness *Buy and store what your family eats. You have to be able to eat and use your food storage everyday to be able to rotate it. The best reason to store what your family eats is that in a time of emergency, if you’ve only stored the basics like wheat, beans, rice, etc. and your family’s diet is suddenly changed, (perhaps even at the same time you’re all experiencing stress), you and your family’s stomachs and digestive tracts are not going to be cooperative and calm. Times of stress are not the ideal occasion to suddenly change your whole diet. This is especially true for children. *Most foods will last longer than many people think, (especially if they have to) if they are stored well. Rotation is the key. Also, containers are important. Nearly everything must be kept dry and airtight. Temperature is important, and is often the determining factor in the shelf life of many foods. Cool is better that warm. Dry is much better than damp. Insects must be kept under control. Open containers invite pests to come and make themselves at home. *Don’t panic when you think of all you need and want to store. It won’t happen overnight. You should plan your storage as a family and set priorities for storing what you feel is most important first. You can supplement it as time goes by, for as long as you are able to. Sometimes it may require sacrifice from your family. It’s up to you to decide how much you want to invest. There’s no wrong way. Any storage is better than none, and every little addition is great. *A simple, almost painless way to build your food storage is to just buy extra products every time you go to the store. Whenever you buy something, buy two. When something’s on sale, buy the limit. If there is no limit and you can afford it, stock up. *Your storage should be kept in a dry, clean, cool and hopefully pest-free, and organized place in your home. If you have not organized your storage either on paper or in its set-up, rotation will be difficult. It’s also hard to see how much you have and decide what you still need. If space is a problem, you may decide to sacrifice a piece or two of furniture (ex. China cupboard, potted plant, spare bed, end table, bedside table, etc.), then put food storage in its place. If it’s impossible to fit all your storage in one room in your home, you could break it up (ex.: water storage and camping gear-garage; canned food-kids’ bedroom; first-aid supplies-bathroom; boxed items-your bedroom; candles, batteries, & other emergency supplies-front room; paper products- basement). Be sure not to put tempting, easily opened foods in the children’s rooms. The temptation may prove to be too much for them. However, they need to be taught now the importance and sacred need for the food storage in which you invest. If you really find it difficult to find space for storage, be creative. Don’t let the lack of space be your excuse not to prepare. Try unusual places like under the bed, inside coffee tables or end tables, behind the sofa, in empty spaces in drawers and closets, etc. If this is the method you are forced to use in your home, be very sure you keep a good record of where you’re putting everything. Wherever you store, just remember that the temperature must be cool, and it needs to be as dry as possible. *Besides your food storage and emergency supplies, you should have a separate 72-hour (3 day & 3 night) kit. This should contain the minimum amount of food, clothes, and water for each family member. 72 hour kits should also include any needed medication, an emergency shelter (a tarp or cheap lightweight tent), a first-aid kit, candles, waterproof matches, pocket knife, flashlight w/batteries, and some kind of blanket, bedding or lightweight sleeping bag. Each kit can be added to as desired, but should be relatively lightweight and easy to carry. Your 72 hour kits should be packed tightly into backpacks, duffel bags, etc. and should be in an easily accessible location (ex: hall closet, near the front door, garage, tool shed, or the trunk of your car). Be sure to rotate out all food, water and medicine periodically to keep them fresh. This is especially important if your 72 hour kits are stored in an outside storage location (trunk, shed, garage, etc.). Complete kits are available for purchase, but it’s less expensive to put together your own, with exactly the items you desire to met the needs of your family. *Remember: Store what you eat, and eat what you store! (If you think preparedness is not important, imagine what would have happened to Noah and his family if they had put off building the ark, gathering the animals, and laying in their food and supplies!) Part Two Storage List: FOOD Alum (white, powdered)- An imperative food item, with medical uses, to store. When sprinkled on an open wound it will draw out infection and any drainage. It will leave the sore disinfected and dry, and will speed healing. (Buy alum in the spice department at your grocery store.) Applesauce- Whether canned, bottled, homemade, or store-bought, cinnamon flavored or unsweetened, applesauce is very convenient and nutritious. It has a long storage life if sealed airtight, and can be used in cooking (pancakes, bread, muffins, cake, cookies, and even casseroles). Since it has natural sweetness it can even supplement or replace sugar inmost recipes. The old adage \"an apple a day keeps the doctor away\" aptly applies to applesauce (and apple juice). Baking Powder- If you’ll be doing baking, you’ll want to have some on hand. Baking Soda- There are so many uses for baking soda that a boo could be written on it’s uses. It can be used as a deodorant, mouthwash, toothpaste, cleaning and scouring agent, degreaser, and a natural deodorizer. It has leavening properties and can be mixed with cream of tarter to make baking powder. 1/2 tsp. mixed in a 4-oz. glass of water is good for upset stomachs (remember bicarbonate of soda?). In laundry it’s good as cleaner and water softener. It also makes soaps stretch farther. It can be used as a coolant for the skin, especially for sunburn, rash, bee-sting, poison ivy and oak. Helps maintain pH in water. Baking soda can be used safely without polluting the ground water. It also makes a great fire extinguisher. Basil- Excellent seasoning for all foods and dishes. Stores well in airtight containers. Basil tea taken hot stops vomiting and eases stomach cramps. Helpful when applied to snake bites and insect stings. (The tea is made 2 tsp. per hot cup water once a day.) Beans & Lentils- Excellent and important storage item. Even when stored so long that they get quite hard, simply soak them for a little longer before using. Put ginger in the water while soaking beans to lessen problems with gas. Beans are a great source of protein. Cooks well over a campfire if soaked before cooking. When sprouted, their nutritional value increases greatly and offers inexpensive, year-round fresh greens too add to your diet. Beef Jerky- or other cured smoked meat needs no refrigeration and tastes as good as it is convenient, while offering important protein. Black Pepper- Convenient, versatile seasoning. Stretches a long way. Bottled Salad Dressing- Your favorite flavor will be a good way to eat sprouts (if you’ve discovered the benefits and ease of sprouting your grains, beans, legumes and lentils). When sprouts and dressing are joined by canned or fresh vegetables, you have a fiber-rich, nutritious salad. Bullion Cubes- Great for broth to feed an invalid or sick person. Good to use as a base for any soup. Simply add any vegetable, grain, meat, pasta, etc. Can be used to make gravy, or r in the water while boiling rice. Stores well in airtight container. Candy- A special treat now will become an even more special treat in time of emergency when luxuries are scarce. Wouldn’t it be nice to have candy to give a child on their birthday if they had no other gift? Candy also offers a quick burst of energy because of the high sugar content. Candy could well be one of the more popular items for barter (as would soda pop). Luxury items usually are. Most candy will store for a fairly long time (though it may lose color, flavor or texture slightly), if kept absolutely airtight, cool and especially DRY. Individually wrapped candy is better than soft. If you decide too store candy be very cautious about leaving any open for any length of time. It’s an invitation to ants and other insects. Canned Foods- Stores for a very long time. Try to keep dry and undented. Bulging cans must be thrown away. Rotation is very important. Many canned foods are complete meals and don’t require other foods to complete. Be sure to have at least one manual can opener. A good variety of canned foods are a smart foundation to your food storage. Examples of canned foods you may want to consider storing are: Soup Stew Fruit Vegetables Juice Pasta (ravioli, spaghetti, etc.) Spam Evaporated milk Sweetened condensed milk Chili Pork and beans Meat (turkey, chicken, etc.) Tuna Cinnamon- Yummy added to oatmeal, bread, wheat, cereal, cookies, hot chocolate, etc. Cold Cereal- In it’s sealed package, in a dry place, most cold cereals will store 1 to 2 years. Besides being eaten with milk for breakfast, some kinds of cereal make handy, nutritious snacks straight from the box. It’s very important to use and rotate your storage of cold cereals. This will provide you with maximum freshness for the longest period of time. Condiments- These are important to store for your own use as well as use for possible barter. These are the often-overlooked items, which will make a big difference when you are dependent on your food storage. Important examples: Mustard Relish Mayonnaise (rotate!) Horseradish Steak sauce Ketchup Barbecue sauce Soy sauce Tabasco/hot sauce Salsa Corn Meal- Healthy, tasty, and versatile. Can be used for fry batter, bread, pone, muffins, cornbread, and pancakes. Corn Starch- Cornstarch can be used in place of talcum or baby powder. Great for diaper rash and other rashes. Absorbs moisture. Great for cooking. Used as a thickener with simple broth to make gravy. Also will stretch soup and thicken it. It has carbohydrates to provide energy. Dehydrated and/or Freeze-Dried Foods- These are the foods with the moisture removed. This allows for extremely long storage. These are convenient and lightweight to carry, and are easy to prepare. Water rehydrates them. Flavor is retained, and it takes much less space to store per serving than other food storage items because the process shrinks the food to 1/8 to 1/7 their normal size. They don’t need to packed in space consuming water like canned foods. (Often, though, the \"water\" from canned foods can be used.) You can dehydrate foods yourself in your oven (lowest setting, door ajar), or in the sun at temperatures of at least 110 degrees. The process takes an average of about 18 hours. Turn the layer of food occasionally during process. Dried or Ramen Soup- Complete, nutritious, lightweight, and easy to prepare. Requires only hot water. Stores for a very long time because there is no moisture in it. (which is what limits the shelf life of some foods). Flavorings- Vanilla, almond, and maple are the most common and useful, though others (orange, lemon, etc.) can be included to suit your families preferences. These could one day be handy when creativity with your food supply has you trying to make new and different foods. Flour- Many uses!! Thin flour water (plus dash salt) batter will make tortillas. (Fry on both sides dry or in oil.) Flour can also be used as a thickener. Be sure to ROTATE. It can be stored in the freezer for longer storage but needs to be kept dry. Flour can help blood clot on small wounds. (Put a handful over wound and hold firmly with hand until blood flow stops. If you add salt or alum into the flour, it will help disinfect.) Gatorade/Sports Drink- These drinks can restore vital minerals and nutrients and prevent dehydration (which can be fatal). Their shelf life is fairly long unopened. Ginger- Powdered or gingerroot. Made into a tea it can be used as a decongestant (like hot mustard plaster, but better because it won’t burn the skin). Just immerse a towel, rag or old shirt in a strong, heated ginger tea and place on chest to loosen chest congestion. It causes heat even after it’s cooled, though it can be re-rinsed in the warm tea. A milder tea can be drunk for upset stomach and gas. Ginger in the water of beans as they soak will control gas problems. Ginger is a good spice to add to any cooked vegetable. It’s often used in Chinese cooking. Hard Red Winter Wheat- Of all grains this stores the longest. It can be sprouted to provide you with fresh greens, even with limited water. It can be ground, coarse or fine, to make flour. It can be added whole to soups (or ground, as a thickener). It can also be cooked and served as hot cereal. Wheat is rich in iron and vitamin E. When storing grains like wheat you should also get some kind of grinder or handmill. Honey- Every food storage must have honey. It will last forever. Honey, which was found in the tombs of the Egyptian pharaohs, still had it’s beneficial properties. Honey can be used in place of sugar as a sweetener. It’s sweeter than sugar is so use it at a rate of ½ the amount you would sugar. When honey crystallizes simply melt it in hot water (rotate/turn/shake during process). Honey, used on open cuts, will provide a protective covering and will disinfect (though it’s sticky). Honey also helps coat sore throats. Hot Cereal- Though you can use your stores of oats and wheat to make hot cereal, there’s advantages in storing pre-packaged, commercial brands. They store well and are very convenient. It’s especially nice to store a favorite of your family. (ex.: Malt-O- Meal, Cream of Wheat, Maypo, etc.) Instant Hot Chocolate- A nice treat, quick energy and very convenient at home or when camping. It can also be a source of warmth on cold mornings. Baking cocoa powder can be stored too, but it requires more ingredients to use it to make hot chocolate (but it certainly does have many uses in baking that make it a good item for your storage). Instant Mashed Potatoes- A convenient source of the nutrients in potatoes. It will store a very long time. The better the packaging, the longer its shelf life will be. Canned is better than boxed. Mashed potatoes leave stomachs feeling full faster than most foods, which is an advantage when trying to stretch your food storage. Jell-O- This product offers a way to cover the taste of chemically treated water. It can be added to with canned, fresh or dehydrated fruit. Jell can also help relieve diarrhea symptoms. To do this prepare jell as directed with just slightly more water than normal. Then drink the jell water while still warm, like tea. This will also provide necessary liquid to avoid dehydration, which is a big danger of diarrhea. Jelly & Jam- Stores well. Easy topping for pancakes, tortillas, crackers, and all bread items. Adds flavor and sweetness to bland foods. Can be added in small amounts to cake or cookie recipes for extra zing, or for a sweet, fruity flavor if used in place of sugar. Juice- (canned/bottled/boxed/frozen/powdered) An essential storage item. Quick, convenient and very nutritious. Adding a variety of flavors is good addition to your food storage. Juice can be used as a snack or small meal in and of itself. It can be used in cooing in place of other liquids in many recipes. Apple juice can be poured over cold cereal or granola in place of milk. Tomato juice can be used in cooking meat or pasta. Tomato juice or vegetable juice makes an excellent base for soups and stews. Kool-aid- This is another item that will help the water taste better when it’s been chemically treated. It’s also a nice addition to pancake batter or muffins to add a sweet fruity flavor. It contains vitamin C, which is an important one because the body is unable to store it and therefore it must always be replenished. If you store the unsweetened kind (which is much cheaper and compact), be sure you have sugar stored (or sweeten it with honey). You may prefer to store the kind that already has the sugar added because it is so convenient. There are alternate versions of Kool-aid that contain less sugar, and are already sweetened (ex. Crystal Light). For all of these, however, you absolutely must keep them dry. It is important that they remain airtight as well, so it may be a good idea to keep them dry, airtight, and organized for easy access and the ability to rotate, by putting them into a plastic container (Tupperware, Rubbermaid, etc.). Marshmallows- These can be eaten even if they get dried out (which just makes them crunchy). Toasted marshmallows are the highlight of camping. They can be used when cooking yams and pumpkin. They’re also good right out of the bag for energy. Kids love them. Used in making \"cereal treats\" (ex. Rice Krispie treats- though most cereals will work). They should be fresh (not dried out) though to be used this way. A handful added to Jell, during preparation, is also a nice treat. M.R.E.’s- (Meals Ready To Eat) Good for 72 hour kits. Compact, complete, healthy, lightweight, and convenient. Needs no refrigeration, and can even be eaten unheated if necessary. But they are expensive! Nutmeg- Should be used SPARINGLY only. Good sprinkled on hot chocolate and eggnog. Can settle stomachs, nausea, and vomiting. Also can be used as an expectorant. Helps improve appetite and digestion. Good for helping maintain a healthy intestinal tract. In boiling water it can be used as a deodorizer. A good seasoning to add to bland dishes. But remember to use it sparingly, don’t over do it. Oats- Excellent source of bran and fiber. Popular cookie ingredient. Can be added to meat loaf. Makes nutritious and filling hot cereal. (Added nutmeg, cinnamon, raisins, or dehydrated fruit makes it even tastier.) Can be used to make pancakes. Oatmeal baths, masks, and soap are healthy for skin and good for itches and rashes. Oil/Crisco Shortening- Very useful and important, especially when cooking over a campfire or using food storage basics. Butter flavor Crisco can be used in recipes in place of margarine is you have none stored (though powdered butter/margarine is available). Use slightly less Crisco than the recipes call for. Ideas of recipes that this replacement can occur are things like macaroni and cheese, many casseroles, and definitely cookies. Oil is used in making bread, tortillas and crackers. Can be used to make a dressing over sprouts and fresh vegetables. Be sure to rotate. You must do this with these items particularly. It’s necessary to have oil on hand to season cast iron skillets. Packaged Dinners- Examples: Tuna or Hamburger Helper, Noodle Roni, and boxed Macaroni and Cheese. These have both advantages and disadvantages. The negative points are that they usually take up a lot of space per serving over other storage foods. Also, you usually need other foods to prepare them such as milk, margarine or even meat. But if you’ve got butter powder or butter-flavored Crisco and canned or powdered milk, these can be very convenient. (Meat can be omitted or substituted). They are good because flavors (cheese, etc.) and spices are already added. Everything’s pre-cut and pre-measured (though additional pasta, rice, etc. will stretch the number of servings without drastically affecting taste or consistency). You can also add any canned or dehydrated meat to make it a complete, balanced one-dish meal. Pancake Mix- Yummy, quick to make (the best kind to store is the ones that require only water to be added). Be sure to have a good skillet to cook the on. Store completely dry and airtight in cool place. (Muffin Mixes are similar and also a good storage item, but once again, be sure to store ones that need only water to be added unless you have the other needed ingredients stored as well.) Parsley- Fresh or dried. Parsley is rich in vitamin C and in iron, calcium, potassium and vitamin A. Prevents urinary infections. Good for fevers. Excellent for prevention of, or maintenance of, cancer. Cures sting from insect bites when used in a poultice. A tea made from the seeds can be used as a shampoo to kill vermin in the hair. Helps aid digestion (which is the original thought behind sprigs of parsley being placed on dinner plates in restaurants). Excellent addition to soups, salads, coleslaw, potato salad, casseroles, on meat, or cooked into scrambled eggs. Pasta- Some regions have an easier time than others storing pasta do. All pasta, however, will be usable stored for long periods of time IF kept cool (to avoid insects like weevils), dry and completely AIRTIGHT. Simply add any number of food storage items to cooked pasta. For instance, things like powdered cheese; cut-up meat product; spaghetti sauce; vegetables; soup; canned milk; powdered butter, etc. Cooked pasta can be eaten cold or hot. Often, leftover pasta dishes can be fried in a skillet (even over a campfire), either plain, or with added scrambled eggs. Peanut Butter- Excellent source of protein and quick energy. Stores for a very long time unopened. Can be eaten plain or on bread, soda crackers, or tortillas. Travels well and is convenient because it doesn’t need to be cooked or refrigerated. One teaspoon per day gives needed protein. Pop Tarts- These handy food items are surprisingly nutritious and extremely convenient. They can be eaten cold, like a food bar. Or they can be heated in toaster or oven. While camping, they can be heated on a grill or even on a heated rock near a fire. Powdered Butter- A good item to have on hand with innumerable uses. Powdered Cheese- Great to add to pasta or eggs. Makes a good base for a vegetable & cheese soup. Makes easy casseroles. Easily stored dairy item. Powdered Eggs- Stores for an extremely long time if kept in an air-tight container. Add to recipes in place of eggs. Makes scrambled eggs and omelets. Added to leftover pasta (especially mac & cheese) with a little water and/or oil, and fried, makes a yummy meal. Powdered Milk- Must have water to mix with it. Store in an air-tight container in a cool/dry place. Must be used and rotated regularly. Serve it to your family now (plain or mixed with regular milk) to get them accustomed to it. It is a critical item of your storage because it’s needed to use with so many other foods and dishes. Doctors have said tat most people could live healthfully for a month or two on powdered milk alone! Pudding- (boxed mix) With adequate cooling or refrigeration, pudding is a nice treat and a good use of your powdered milk. If refrigeration is a problem, then pudding can be used to make a special treat: \"Quick Shakes\". This is simply unset pudding, but could be viewed as an energy drink because of the calories and carbohydrates it offers. During stress your family will be happy to get such a yummy surprise. It does also offer protein and vitamins. Evaporated milk may also be used (water should be used to dilute the evaporated milk first, however, because it is so rich). Pudding can also be used in baking delicious cakes, cookies or pancakes, by simply using it to replace an equal amount of flour in the recipe. This adds a rich texture and flavor. Rice- Must be stored in a cool and air-tight container. It’s filling and healthy. Water used to cook rice can be saved to drink or use in cooking (it’s high in vitamin B). Rice can be cooked in clear broth to add flavor. It can also be added to soups. To make rice pudding simply add sugar, milk, butter and vanilla. (More things can be added to your taste). Rice can be cooked many ways: steamed fried or boiled. It can be made into a hot cereal. Added vegetables and/or meat make a complete meal. Any spice will add variety (ex.: spanish rice, curried rice, etc.) Salt- In ancient times salt was highly valued. Nowadays this inexpensive item is an excellent addition to your food storage for your own use and for future barter needs. Salt is very versatile. It can be used to cure meat, add flavor to otherwise bland foods, and can be used to help ease the pain of sores. It will speed healing (try it on a canker sore). Apply the salt straight on the wound (it sometimes stings initially), or dilute it with water. ½ tsp. in warm water is good for headaches and indigestion. Sage- Good seasoning for roasts, soups, etc. Can be used as a cure-all. A strong sage tea is an excellent gargle for tonsillitis or ulcers in the throat or mouth (good mixed with lemon and honey). The sage tea can be drunk cold or hot. It’s one of the best remedies for gas, liver, stomach, kidney or bowel trouble. Will stop bleeding and is good used to clean old wounds and ulcers. And wound will heal more quickly when washed with a sage tea. It’s useful for typhoid and scarlet fever, measles and smallpox. Soothes nerves and relieves headaches. An effective hair tonic (will make hair grow if roots haven’t been destroyed), and will remove dandruff. When used in high quantities sage is good for easing female problems, and all lung problems (colds, asthma, coughs, bronchitis, influenza and pneumonia). Tea from sage should be steeped (while covered), not boiled. Soda Crackers- These have a longer shelf life than you might think. The key is to keep them absolutely dry, and of course, air- tight. If they so get soft and stale, it takes only a few minutes to \"re-crisp\" them in the oven. Soda crackers are a bread item in your diet and can even be eaten like sandwiches, topped with tuna salad, meat & cheese, or peanut butter and jelly (it’s good, try it!). Soda crackers can also help alleviate queasiness. They provide the body with salt, and are a good addition to a meal of coup, stew or chili. Spaghetti Sauce- This makes a quick, easy meal out of any pasta item. Vegetables, powdered cheese, meat, or spices can be added to it to taste. Spices- If there are spices that you frequently use, it is a good idea to add them to your food storage so that you are able to continue to \"spice up\" your cooking. Split Peas- These last a long time because they’ve had the moisture removed. Makes good soup. (add enough spices and seasoning to suit the taste preferences of your family. Meat and onion and carrots are also good additions.) Sugar- It’s important to keep sugar cool and very dry, but it’s an important part of any food storage. Also be careful to watch out for ants or insects. If the sugar gets hard it can be chipped or grated and then used with no problem as long as it’s unpolluted with anything. Sugar may be highly prized one day, but remember that honey can also be used as a sweetener at a ratio of half that of sugar. Brown sugar and powdered sugar may be stored as well for their many different uses. Brown sugar is delicious when added to beans, wheat cereal, cookies, and is often used in bread, canning and preserving recipes. Syrup- Though syrup can be made with water, sugar and maple flavoring, it’s very convenient to have some pre-made syrup on hand. It’s better to buy it in small containers so you can use it up in just one or two meals so you don’t have an opened bottle inviting pests (especially if there’s no refrigeration). Yummy when added to pork and beans. Velveeta- This product doesn’t need to be refrigerated when it’s unopened and stores fairly long. It’s good added to many dishes, melted over bread, tortillas or crackers, or eaten plain. It’s a great source of vitamins from the dairy food group. Vinegar- When mixed with honey it’s a cur-all. It can be used as an astringent. It’s a wonderful glass cleaner. It’s used in cooing as a preservative (to pickle-when used with salt and water). Whole Cloves- These are used in cooking meat (like ham), and pickling and preserving. It adds flavoring to fruits, soups and stews. One or two cloves added to lemonade \"spices\" it up. (Most people do not like to eat the cloves, only use it as a spice/seasoning agent.) Whole cloves can be used directly on toothaches to help relieve pain. One clove can freshen breath after only a few minutes in the mouth. A few can be added to the water of vegetables while they are cooking. Several cloves in a pan of hot water is an effective air freshener (added citrus peel and a cinnamon stick makes it even more aromatic-especially during the holiday season). (*If you have access to freezer space, it offers you a wonderful opportunity to store meat, cheese, margarine, and many other great food items. Remember to rotate things as you use/buy them. I, myself, have a large freezer full of food, which I use and have stored. However, it’s extremely important that your ENTIRE food storage is NOT frozen, to prevent the loss of your complete supply if power is lost). Storage List: Health & Grooming Antibiotic Ointment- (ex. Neosporin) Speeds healing. Reduces the risk of injuries becoming more severe from infection. Should be included in first aid kits, 72 hour kits, and a good supply should be included in your storage. Aspirin/Tylenol/Aleve- An absolute MUST! One day it could be your entire pain-killing \"pharmacy\" in a bottle. This may make the difference of pain being bearable or not, for you or a family member. Check expiration dates and rotate as you use it. Baby Powder/Body Powder- Powder, in olden days, was found in great quantities in all the best boudoirs all over the world. This was because they knew it’s advantages in absorbing moisture, controlling odor, and leaving one feeling fresh and dry. That way of thinking may one day be well emulated if the water and opportunity to wash is restricted. But remember that the need to wash is still very important to hygiene and sanitation. So, even if it’s greatly reduced due to water shortage, it should never be replaced completely. Band-Aids/Bandages/Sterile Gauze Pads- A must to have on hand. They will probably be used quickly so store a lot. Bar Soap- You can never store too much. The milder the better. Heavily perfumed or deodorant soap may leave a residue or cause a rash if inadequate water for rinsing is available. Though you should also store some anti-bacterial and/or surgical soap. Calamine Lotion- A good item too have on hand when living at the mercy of mosquitoes, poison ivy, and other skin irritations. You’ll be happy you have this someday, either for yourself or for a family member. Deodorant- Imagine working hard for your family’s survival, sweating profusely, then being unable to shower or wash very often! Or even being able to change into a limitless supply of clothes. You, and those around you, might appreciate having a supply of deodorant. Diarrhea Control Medicine- (such as Imodium AD) In difficult or stressful circumstances, diarrhea can be a serious problem. Especially when there might be tainted food or water supplies. Diarrhea, left unchecked, can cause dehydration, even death. This, and all types of medicine, needs to be rotated according to expiration dates. Hydrogen Peroxide- (and rubbing Alcohol) An excellent source of disinfecting. This item could mean the ability to avoid a severe infection. Besides being used directly on wounds it can also be used to disinfect surfaces (bathroom sinks and counters, and needles to take out slivers). Lotion- When working hard, this will be a luxury item. Misc. First-Aid & Medical Supplies- Take your pick from these following examples of important medical supplies: Ace bandages Antacid Anti-histamine/decongestant Bandage tape Black silk thread (for stitches) Clean scissors (or clean razor blades) Cotton balls Cough syrup or drops Disposable gloves Epsom salt First-Aid book Hot water bottle Ice packs Laxatives Medication to induce vomiting Q-tips Sheets (for bandages and slings) Smelling salts Splints Sterile needles Thermometer Toothache/canker sore medicine Tweezers Vaseline Prescription & Other Medications- These should be stored as far in advance as possible for all family members with special needs (ex.: heart problems, asthma, epilepsy, diabetes, menstrual problems, etc.). Check expiration dates periodically and rotate as you use it. Razors/Shaving Cream- If you don’t plan to be excessively hairy, you’ll need to have a supply of shaving supplies. Don’t forget, an electric razor won’t be good for very much without electricity. Sanitary Napkins/Tampons- These might be overlooked, but be careful not to. Don’t forget growing daughters too. Shampoo & Conditioner- Plan a \"head\". Toothpaste- You’ll be glad you have it. Even of you don’t have a toothbrush and have to use your finger. Remember, it may one day be very hard to find a dentist. Storing spare Toothbrushes, as well as Dental floss, is a good idea also. Storage List: Household & Emergency Supplies Air Mattress/Cot/Ground Pad- If you’re positive that you wouldn’t be able to sleep with a rock in your back on the cold, hard ground, then now is the time to prepare. These items could one day be your bed during an emergency, and would be a real luxury. Patch kits are available to keep air mattresses usable. In the meantime, these items are handy for unexpected guests. Baby items- If you’re expecting, or prone to get pregnant easily items such as formula, cloth diapers, baby clothes, baby food, and bottles could be a blessing to have on hand. If you do not need these items after all, they would be excellent for use as barter to families who find themselves in this unexpected situation. For deliveries it’s good to supply items like sterile scissors, strong silk thread, surgical soap, a nasal aspirator, etc. Batteries- If you’re clever enough to store battery operated radios, lamps, flashlights and so on, you’ll never have too many batteries. Be sure to rotate them now, on an ongoing basis, as you use them. They can be stored in the refrigerator. Keep track of where batteries are in your home (remote control, clock, etc.) so you can use them if you run out during an emergency. Rechargeable batteries should not be your entire store because if there’s no power, then you will soon be out of luck. Blankets- Native Americans used blankets as barter. Pioneers used blankets as heirlooms and wedding gifts. Hours were spent hand-stitching quilts. As blankets became tattered and worn they were put to good use as doors, rugs, tablecloths, and were made into coats. I don’t think, as you become prepared for whatever lies ahead, that you could ever have too many blankets. Especially if they are sturdy and warm. Just imagine how appreciate you would before each and every blanket on a freezing night, especially if you and your children are sleeping without electricity or even outside. If you did end up with too many blankets, there would be a demand for them I’m sure. Bleach- This is an inexpensive storage item that is quite valuable. It can help you have a purified water supply, clean clothes, and disinfect almost anything. Don’t buy a more expensive name brand. Bleach is bleach. Also, avoid bleach with a fragrance added. Bug Spray/Insect Repellent- These may one day be your only line of defense against those pests who often carry diseases. Mosquito netting may be a good investment as well. Camp Shovel/Hatchet/Hammer/Saw/Axe- If you are living in the great outdoors, or in reduced circumstances, you’ll need the tools to help you survive. Digging latrines or cooking pits, chopping wood, setting up tents and clotheslines may be daily activities some time in the future. Even id you’re living in your home, but are unable to use the toilet because of lack of water, you’ll need to dig a substitute one. Cast Iron Skillet/Dutch Oven- Skillets work really well over a campfire if they are seasoned. They retain heat and cook evenly. Candles- Quick and easy to use. Portable. Takes no batteries, kerosene or electricity. Be sure to store candleholders too! Smokeless, dripless tapers are nice, but big, wide candles last longer. Votive candles aren’t as good because they don’t last very long. Clothes- Sturdy, well-made clothes for all seasons are important to have for each member of the family. If you have growing children be prepared with sizes to accommodate their growth. Remember that fashion will not matter. Quality and fit will mean much more. Thick socks and sturdy shoes are excellent to have. Extra pairs might want to be considered. Work gloves, winter gloves and hats, extra shoelaces, dependable wristwatches, winter coats, warm pajamas, and so on are all very good items to have on hand. Be sure to have each item for each member of the family. Clothesline/Clothes Pins- Back to basics. When clothes get wet, or hand washed, you’ll need a way to dry them to prevent mold for forming. Clotheslines can also make temporary shelters with sheets, blankets, tarps, and tablecloths draped over them. Dish Pans & Dish Drainers- Most of us have been spoiled by automatic dishwasher and don’t’ have these useful things on hand. These will become important to having clean, sanitary dishes and pots and pans if you are without power. Also, if water is in short supply, the dish-panful of water would have to last. These can be used indoors or out. They don’t cost a lot, so they are a good investment. Garden Seeds- Be sure to store non-hybrid seeds to get the maximum amount of harvest after the first year. Store seeds in a dry place. Growing your own fresh produce is a wonderful addition to a stored diet and allows you to survive on a more permanent basis. Make sure to store enough extra water to keep your garden growing through dry times. Never water your garden in the heat and light of mid-day. Include herbs in your garden. They add flavor to all meals and often have medicinal qualities. Grinder or Hand Mill- This is a necessary item to have to grind wheat or other grains, into flour or meal, if you have them in your food storage. Though expensive, electric grinders are easy and fast. Hand mills are good when there’s no electricity. Kerosene- Return to the old days. What worked for your grandparents will work for you. Kerosene stored for a long time. Be sure to keep it upright. If you store kerosene, make sure you have lamps to use with it, and visa-versa. Liquid Dish Soap- Versatile product. Besides washing dishes, it can wash clothes, camping gear, shoes, floors, and hands. Lysol- (or other disinfecting spray) This is a great way to control germs (& odors) which can cause disease. Great caution must be taken, however, not to get any on food or food preparation areas, or where children or pets could get it into their hands (or paws) or in their mouths. Matches- Long-handled fireplace matches are great. Also any wood match is good. They should be stored in watertight containers. Flint, fire-starting stones are very handy with limitless uses. You should also try to store at least some waterproof matches. These are good in 72-hour kits. Means of Mobility- Be creative. Bicycles, wheelbarrows, handcarts, wagons, etc. You need to think ahead of what you might use to transport yourself and your supplies in an emergency situation. You may want to store repair supplies like extra inner tubes, tire patch kit, etc. Paper Plates/Cups/Bowls & Plastic Utensils- When water becomes scarce, and sanitation is a problem, these will be extremely important to you. The best and least expensive plates to store are the cheap, plain white ones sold in packages of 100 or more, often for less than a dollar. They take up little space and when used with re-usable plate holders they’re stronger than the bulkier, more expensive styrofoam plates. Paper Towels- These can be used as disposable towels, tissues, napkins, wash cloths, and toilet paper. Well worth the effort to save them. Pencils/Pens & Paper- These will become more valuable and appreciated as access to them stops. You will want to be able write journals, recipes, notes, and reminders. If you find yourself home-schooling your children, paper and pencils would be invaluable. (Books too.) Pet Food- If Rover or Fluffy are important members of the family don’t forget to store food for them. Be sure to use and rotate, especially dry food. Canned pet food stores quite a long time. Pets can also live on many regular food items you might have stored (especially if they’re hungry). Even beef or chicken broth. Though they may help the rodent population by supplementing their diet themselves. Plastic Wrap/ Foil/ Wax Paper/Trash Bags/Ziplock Bags- Important items for food preparation and storage. Only unscented clear or white trash bags should be used to hold unwrapped food. All trash bags make good ground cover, emergency ponchos, equipment cover, and makeshift shelters. Foil is great for cooking in, or over, a campfire. Ziplock bags are versatile for holding food, matches, candles, first-aid supplies, even a dry pair of socks. Wax paper is good for food preparation work space. Pocket Knife/Hunting Knife- Let your imagination tell you all the reasons why these are critical emergency storage items. Radio- (Short-wave or transistor) Be sure it runs without electricity and is portable. A simple antenna is an added investment. This could be your link to the outside world in case of emergency. Rope/Nylon Cord- This may turn out to be one of your most valuable supplies. Uses include everything from creating shelter, to emergency rescue, to a creative outdoor shower or latrine. Safety Pins- Whether living in your home, or in the open, safety pins have limitless uses from clothing repair to first aid. Scrub Brush/Broom/Bucket/Mop- Cleanliness and sanitation may one day be very important to keep you and your family healthy, as well as comfortable. Even living in a tent, a broom will be handy to keep the floor of the tent clean and dry. A simple twig, when stepped on, can cause a rip in the tent fabric. How much easier to sweep it out than to worry about repairing your tent. Sewing Kit- The size and contents are up to you. For instance, if you have stored fabric you’ll need plenty of thread. But every household will need a sewing kit of some kind to keep clothes, blankets and towels in good repair. A smaller version is ideal for 72-hour kits. Tarp- This is another versatile item. The more you have on hand, the more you’ll find uses for. A few ideas are: a ground cover, a shower, a tent, as well as means of protecting your firewood and supplies. Toilet Paper- Do I even need to say how very important you might one day find this item to be? It could be quite valuable, in fact. I know that I would much prefer it over leaves and dirty scraps of paper. It will store forever if you keep it dry. Towels- When you can’t do a load of laundry every day, and you and your family are trying to stay clean and dry, and when you are trying to keep pots and pans and dishes clean, you will treasure every single towel you posses. Especially if you lose or ruin any and are unable to replace them. Towels also make good throw rugs when living in a tent. Travel Game/Deck of Cards- If you had no TV, movies, video games or libraries at your disposal, how much would you and your children appreciate a diversionary activity? Put a couple in your 72-hour kits. These items could be invaluable to keep children occupied while you are busy. Vinyl Tablecloths- These provide more than just a clean eating area. They can be used as blankets, curtains, ground cover, and emergency shelters. They can also be made into raincoats or ponchos. In an emergency, they can be cut down to be placed around feet by tying a cord around the ankles to keep in place. Shower curtains can be used in similar ways to these tablecloths, though with less durability, thickness or warmth. Never throw away old shower curtains or vinyl tablecloths. They could still be quite useful. Water- This is, without question, the single most important and life-saving item you could store! Besides being necessary to drink, it’s needed to wash clothes and dishes and to bathe in. It will need to be used sparingly because no matter how much you have, you’ll never know how long you will have to depend on your supply. I fear that long before people would start to panic over finding food, they will be desperate for water. Water can be stored in glass or plastic containers (except milk containers because they are biodegradable), and must have an airtight lid. A small piece of plastic wrap placed over the mouth of the container before you put the lid on helps keep the water fresh. You can use tap water plain if you change it once a year, or add a small amount of bleach or other commercial purification product before storing indefinitely. You can also boil water before using to kill germs and improve the taste. Try to store your water in a cool place. Don’t overlook the water in your toilet tank and water heater in an unexpected crisis. Waterbed water can be used for washing, but don’t drink it or use it on eating surfaces because of contamination due to the chemicals used in making the plastic lining. Water Purification Tablets or Containers/Filter Pumps- An absolute must. These can be life-saving. They can help turn most unusable or questionable water sources into safe drinking water. These are especially vital when living \"on the trail\" or outdoors. Boiling water helps remove the bacteria too.

FREEDOM THROUGH TEACHING OTHERS SELF RELIANCE ESTABLISHED: JANUARY 2009 he 72-hour kit or 3-day survival pack is based in military preparedness––soldiers carried survival supplies when involved in military operations to allow them to protect themselves, to provide the necessities to take care of their personal needs, and to complete their as- signed mission. For the average citizen, it’s a ready-to-use package containing food and water rations, supplies, and such other vital equipment for maintaining personal well-being—or, at least, staying alive when forced into extremely dangerous or uncontrollable circumstances. The idea of individuals and families having survival kits is based on the firm—and confirmed— belief that natural disasters and personal emergencies is not a matter of whether they will happen, but when. Having a few basic categories of supplies and provisions on hand can mitigate that help- less feeling caused by emergencies. Being prepared reduces the panic associated with the occur- rence of seemingly uncontrollable events. In a complete readiness plan, one would have survival kits available for all possible situations: \\uf0b7 at home \\uf0b7 at work \\uf0b7 at play \\uf0b7 in the car / truck \\uf0b7 traveling by boat / bus / plane / train \\uf0b7 at school / college \\uf0b7 when on vacation / hotel / overnight \\uf0b7 other: _____________________________ When designing or purchasing a survival kit, consider the level of preparedness you wish to achieve for yourself or your family. A most important aspect of a survival kit is that it be able to keep you alive and well when you are confronted with an emergency or survival situation. Use the information in this chapter to organize your own Emergency Preparedness Action Kit (E/PAK), as we have nicknamed it––our version of the 72-hour kit. Or, you can purchase one that meets your needs. The listings at the end of this article identify some providers of ready-made kits you can buy off the shelf. T History is a better guide than good in- tentions. Jeanne Kirkpa- trick Former US Am- bassador to the UN YOUR PERSONAL E/PAK… 72-HR.+ EMERGENCY/PREPAREDNESS ACTION KIT 2 \\uf0aeYour Personal & Family E-PAK MY MOTHER’S WISDOM I learned about preparedness and survival kits from my mother. She was wisdom personified and always seemed to know what to do, no matter what the occasion! I truly regret it took me so long to realize it. As a fledgling Boy Scout––less than a Tenderfoot, actually––the troop was going on a long-awaited and unprecedented early spring camping trip. At last, I was going to be with the older boys whom I not only admired, but secretly revered. The last thing I wanted was to be embarrassed by being unprepared––heaven forbid, imagine not being prepared at 12 years of age! When I asked Mother what to take on this extended outing, she replied in her soft-spoken manner, practically without a moment’s hesitation, ―You need to wonder what could happen and be willing to pay the wages of wandering in the wilderness. Take some water, Wranglers, weenies, wipes, warm clothing, weather protection, a weapon, a wayfinder, and whatever, and keep a watchful eye...‖ I knew this was going to be ―W‖ formula, no doubt! Let me elaborate on her method of guidance. She had taught me everything in the world operated on a formula. The only other ―W‖ formula she had told me was, ―Working will win when wishing won’t!‖ Evaluate these ―W‖ formula preparedness pointers in relationship to your own emergency and dis- aster preparedness efforts. Wonder: determine, by some serious thinking, what problems might occur in the field (or in my life), such as: – To which wonders of Nature I’d be vulnerable, – What some other creature––man or beast––might cause me harm, or – Which personal problems I might suffer. I think she wanted me to ponder what experiences I might not be able to control. She wanted me to plan for the worst, hope for the best, and be able to deal eventually with whatever happened. Willing/Wages: meant that I must be willing to pay the price to make this trip––time, effort, and risk. From the available alternatives, was this most practical, prudent, and provident for me? I had to decide if it was the most ―bang for my buck‖ at that moment—and about the longer-term conse- quences and implications. Even at that early age, I had already become aware of the consequences of being unprepared. Mother was indicating the price I would pay for not being prepared for the future eventualities in my life. Wander: once departed from her presence, the security I had at home would be unavailable, and it would be as if I were wandering in the wilderness, all alone. Water: ―Take water,‖ she said. ―You can’t live very long without drinking water––just a few hours without it and you’re in deep trouble! Of course, that’s not necessarily true of taking a bath in times of emergency. But it is one of those things a young boy can learn to do without, at least during a weekend or an emergency. You can live three days without water, but you get weaker every hour without it.‖ Wranglers: meant having appropriate clothing for the occasion, depending on the environment. In my youth, jeans (we could afford the name brand Wranglers only after the harvest was in the barn) were the working-class clothes in our ex-urban community—could be worn for man’s work––and camping out, too. They were sturdy clothing, long-wearing, tough, and easily maintained. This admonition was also meant to include a regular change of underwear. (How embarrassing to be wearing dirty underwear in case you were taken to the hospital after a camping accident!) Weenies: meant the need for nourishment. My mother knew my penchant for hot dogs and pork and beans. Her instruction to me was to take food that (1) I would eat even under the stress of be- ing away from the well-spread table she always prepared; (2) is easily prepared in the boonies; and (3) I’d normally enjoy. (I would have preferred her homemade oyster stew––but that would have been totally impractical for the camping environment––as it would be for most emergency situa- tions!) We are capable of doing without a lot of things, even when we’re stressed. However, having famil- iar food to eat when everything else is going badly gives us comfort far beyond the cost of the food. Food is such an important part of creating and maintaining a positive attitude, especially Preparedness is the state of being prepared or in put in proper condition of readiness before an approaching event––something expected, even thought possible, or unexpected; to put things or one- self in readiness. Webster’s Dictionary Notes Note the wide mar- gins––make notes and use the space for your questions, ideas, and plans to make certain your future is as secure as possible. . 72-Hr.+ Emergency/Preparedness Action Kit \\uf0ae 3 when all else is falling apart, that it bears repeating: don’t take anyone else’s opinion about your emergency food supply––store what you like to eat and you’ll eat what you’ve stored––and you won’t lose it! Wipes: intimated that if I ate during this camping trip, eventually the natural necessity for wipes would occur. Not to mention a runny nose from the overnight in the wilderness! Wipes were in- deed essential then for any trip away from home––and still are! This was also meant to remind me about the need for good personal hygiene and grooming––a little soap and elbow grease to remove the dirt and smoke odor from my body and clothing. There is no greater comfort than being our best self––putting our best foot forward––handling whatever we encounter with panache and style. Warmth: how can anyone be prepared if the elements are ignored? Back then, the job of finding both small and effective means of keeping warm was more difficult. Today we have modern tech- nology––so many new fabrics for clothing and camping gear, equipment, and supplies to help in this life-saving necessity. Of course, let us not forget the need for fire to prepare food, purify wa- ter, and provide warm water for bathing. Weather protection: this was the need for adequate shelter from the unpredictable spring weather in North Carolina––a tent and some waterproof matches. For today’s considerations it includes the provision of living space that precludes a family from suffering the effects of inclement weather–– whether it’s intemperate climate, moisture, or wind-driven forces. Weapon: a brand-new Swiss knife attached to my belt for all to see––talk about proud! Nobody was going to mess with me and the complete arsenal at my fingertips. I was prepared for even a bear! Besides, it was a miracle-making tool just waiting to be unleashed, whether for opening a can of weenies, beans or soup, shaving a stick for fire tender, or carving an ―X‖ on a tree to mark the trail (forgive me, tree-huggers––I was only 12 years old!) Wayfinder: meant having the appropriate equipment, such as a wrist compass and a local area road map. At least, I could find my way back to the camp, home, or anywhere on that map, should I be the victim of a ―snipe hunt‖ with the senior scouts. Make sure you have maps of local streets, as well as maps of your destination, if you must depart from your home. Watchful eye: this part of the communication was a little bit trickier because it was somewhat more philosophic, but I know it meant being prepared for any emergency. I practiced until I was compass-trained and physically ready to take the fifty-mile hike. I was also required to learn all the first aid information, up to and including how to cut the ―X‖ through the skin for subsequent snakebite treatment. Thank heaven that treatment has been superseded! Actually, upon reflection, I couldn’t have cut the snake, much less cut an ―X‖ on my own body! Whatever: meant a category was for anything I wanted to take that wasn’t in the proscribed cate- gories listed above––like my genuine silver-plated Duncan yo-yo!…or the latest Marvel comic book… or jacks and marbles––whatever was important then for my comfort and pleasure under trying conditions! Watchcare: meant caring about the others on the camping trip. This was a quality my mother had in bountiful supply––she really cared about others, constantly on the lookout for someone who needed a lift. Her ―good neighbor‖ policy was in full force at all times. She practiced the true spirit of caring about those in her community. So, my mother’s instructions sent me scurrying enthusiastically throughout all three floors of the house, looking for the equipment I needed to impress the older Scouts in the troop. As the see- mingly essential items were located, I placed all the pieces of equipment and little piles on my up- per bunk, then called her for approval. At this point I learned how to choose what is essential, and how to focus on economy, efficiency, and personal well-being. Mother regarded all the gear and paraphernalia I had assembled. I remember her saying quietly, “Pep without purpose is piffle!” She gently (well, not so gently that I soon forgot!) instructed me to sort all of my stuff into three piles. I was to place in the first pile the items I couldn’t do without, a second pile for ―stuff‖ I thought I might need, and a third pile for the things I’d like to take with me. Notes Planning will assure you’ve considered your needs in case of an emergency, disas- ter, or life-threatening situations. 4 \\uf0aeYour Personal & Family E-PAK After I had ordered my piles as instructed, mother looked at the three piles carefully and made a couple of corrections to my piles. She then told me to return the stuff heaped in the second and third piles to the drawers and closets––and to place in the camp bag only the items in the first pile. You know, even years later, mother’s words were my guidance when I traveled more than a million miles as an international business traveler. What I eventually learned is that the quality of any trip is being able to travel without a great deal of non-elemental ―stuff.‖ SURVIVAL OR PREPAREDNESS KITS? Responsibility for your family begins in your own home. You are ultimately responsible for pro- tecting yourself, your family, and your property to the best of your capability. This entails planning and preparing your own resources to mitigate the effects of by preparing for, responding to, and eventually, recovering from natural and people-caused disasters that often become our personal disasters. Being prepared requires learning about potential disasters and emergencies, knowing first aid, CPR, and other life-saving skills. Adaptability is critical to preparedness and self-reliance. A sense of independence is necessary, too. Unfortunately, self-reliance skills are not taught in the schools––they are learned at the hand of a tough and uncaring taskmaster! How well you respond to these disasters is determined by your level of preparation. There are five basics you should stock in your home: (1) water, (2) food, (3) first aid supplies, in- cluding medication(s), (4) clothing and bedding, and (5) tools, emergency supplies, and special needs items. Keep the items you will most likely need during an evacuation in an easy-to-carry container such as a large, covered trash container, camping bag, backpack, or duffel bag. Keep a mini-version of the disaster supplies kit in the trunk of your car—and one for each vehicle your family utilizes. Utilize all the knowledge you can gain to prepare for the disasters which could cause you and your family more than loss of your car, your property, or your crops. To become truly prepared, you must re-forge yourself, break out of the mold, study, learn, practice, and increasingly improve your self-reliance skills until you are comfortable with your new self. There is no easy way to become self-reliant—it requires work! To become self-reliant requires also meaningful efforts in self- education and often, some large measures of self-denial. IT’S YOUR CHOICE––MINIMAL …OR MORE? There are different levels or factors of risk associated with the many different types of disasters. There are varying levels of preparation. So this is the best rule for becoming prepared: Your preparation level should always exceed the risk level! Go back to Chart 1 – Potential Weather-Related Disasters by Listed to see the listing of the expected weather-related disasters that could affect your particular geographic location. There are three (3) types of actions from which you can choose to help you deal with these poten- tially disastrous weather-related conditions should you be victimized by them. You alone make the choice from among these options: 1. Survival––requiring minimal investment or effort; survival mode places you in the con- trol of happenstance and volunteers––or not! 2. Preparedness (at some level)––all levels of preparedness require serious effort and sub- stantial investment of your time, personal energy, and money; and, 3. Self-Reliance––preparing at the highest level of your family’s capability, learning, doing, and adapting your lifestyle; sharing and being a resource to your community.

Use the charts to determine what you have in inventory already for your family E/PAK and to de- fine the needs for each member of the family––items, quantities, and selections of foods, foods- tuffs, and equipment. Keep items for a family evacuation in easy-to-carry containers. You decide whether a large, covered trash container, camping backpack, footlocker, plastic chest, or duffel bag suits your needs best. If you have the resources, keep an E/PAK in the trunk of your car. You may want one at your place of business, also. It’s cheap insurance for saving your life––or the life of a family member, a friend, or a co-worker! Hopefully, most of us won’t need the E/PAK, but being prepared for the eventuality is good to ease the mind. I hope the worst case for our individual E/PAK is to have in a central location all the things we’d need for ―hunkering down‖ when a natural disaster, such as a wind, ice, or snowstorm, or a people-caused disaster causes a power outage. ―Bug-out‖ or Not? Personally, I don’t plan to ―bug-out!‖ I don’t have any other place I want to go, unless it’s to an expensive hotel that has complete and luxurious facilities. With my 3-day kit in hand, I could even endure a public shelter! I just don’t intend to leave my home and all the equipment unless a life- threatening disaster requires it. Having reviewed the potential natural, people-caused, and personal disasters that could possibly happen to me, the alternatives are clear to me as to what I would do in each case. I’ve spent the weekend in a church recreation hall with several other families, during and in the aftermath of an ice storm. It wasn’t too bad––the worst part was the lack of privacy and no heat. I’ve also spent a few days at my parents’ house––kids and all––when the side of town where we lived had a power failure––and we had an all-electric home! I certainly don’t intend to head for the unfamiliar hills, living in the wilderness fraught with unknown dangers, chasing wild animals with switches, fending off others in a similar plight, and trying to maintain an urban lifestyle. However, the very thought of driving on the freeway or city streets during a disaster situation, competing for space with all those folks carrying handguns (even the ones with permits) and other weapons is just a little frightening to me. Whereas I can’t defend the entire city, I could maintain my independence in my own home with adequate provisions. My plans are to enjoy the disaster and appreciate the intervention in my normally extra-long work- day to spend it with my wife, my dogs, and the peace and quiet the lack of electricity would bring. Perhaps it would be a moment to pretend it’s another vacation in the back hills of the Appala- chians… Choose and act accordingly! Carpe diem because tempus fugit! 72-Hr.+ Emergency/Preparedness Action Kit \\uf0ae 7 Rotation! The rules of rotation are not suspended for your E/PAK! Every 90 to 180 days the E/PAK should be inventoried. Exchange water, food, and clothing for current supplies. Consume the goods to assure yourself of your choices. Check to assure the E/PAK is re-provisioned with your new inven- tory, and re-set in its storage location. Enjoy this requirement for rotation. Buy some really good gourmet-type foods for your E/PAK (you’d certainly eat the gourmet- and picnic-quality foodstuffs you’d find at a high-class business party, classy brunch, or invitation-only social event) and have an ―emergency picnic‖ with your rotated foods. These emergency preparedness ―trial runs‖ will provide occasional practice for the time(s) when disasters for which you’ve prepared actually occur. It’ll further prepare you mentally for the eventuality of a disaster, and make the event’s foreboding nature a little more bearable. E/PAK Categories Supply categories are as follows, with the correlation of E/PAK categories to my Mother’s list: E/PAK Categories Mother’s Categories 1. Drinking water Water 2.

There is no intent in this document to discuss all the causes and solutions for emergencies and dis- asters. There are, however, numerous resources which can help you prepare for natural or people- caused disasters, or for any resultant personal disasters that might occur to you and your family. There is an additional listing of resources on the back page. For all the minute details of 72-hour (or longer) emergency preparedness issues, there are a few books I suggest you read and utilize. One of the best overall books is Barbara Salisbury’s, ―PLAN ...NOT PANIC, 72-Hour Survival/Emergency Evacuation.”1 She also has a newer book, Preparedness Principles, with some additional excellent ideas. Preparedness Principles is a big, comprehensive volume of work about preparedness. Barbara––whom I’ve known since 1972 and respected some time before then––defines an evacua- tion as a localized occurrence which forces residents from their homes on a moment’s notice. It only takes being forced from your home one time to convince the wise person of the need for an emergency kit that is prepared in advance and available for use when needed. In her book, origi- nally published in May 1994, she provides step-by-step instructions––missing from most other emergency/disasters publications––for the preparation of a personalized 72-hour kit. As I read her book cover to cover, I’ll remark on some things she points out that are critical for each of us to know: \\uf071 It\\'s a fact of life that sooner or later you may have to be evacuated from your home! \\uf071 Panic takes over if practical preparation has been ignored. \\uf071 Lag-Time\\uf032––not the disaster––is the reason for a 72-hour kit! This is probably the least understood point in this facet of emergency preparedness. \\uf071 Lag-Time is the villain of most evacuations. It is imperative to understand its impact on all facets of preparation for an evacuation. \\uf071 The more severe the disaster, the greater the corresponding impact of Lag-Time. \\uf071 Lag-Time is why you can\\'t rely on the government or emergency disaster organizations to come to your aid immediately. \\uf071 When individuals are prepared to take care of themselves, they have greater security. \\uf071 Properly prepared persons are a tremendous help for those who eventually arrive to assist and support in disaster situations. According to Barbara, the critical parameters of a well-planned and well thought-out 72-hour evacuation and survival plan are: \\uf071 Understanding the two categories of emergency preparedness and how it affects not only your preparation, but also your ultimate survival. \\uf071 Using a Neighborhood Evaluation Form to determine if there is a potential evacuation lurking in your future. \\uf071 Creating a 72-hour kit economically to meet your personal needs. \\uf071 Including more than three “energy bars” and a flashlight in your 72-hour kit! \\uf071 Knowing why the right kinds of foods are vital in an emergency situation––and are very different from those typically kept on the emergency shelf. \\uf071 Having an emergency water supply is essential. \\uf071 Designing your own „\\'security blanket.‟‟ 1 Barbara Salsbury is a nationally recognized consumer specialist, author, and lecturer. Among the many cre- dits of this author is her book Plan...Not Panic––The 72 Hour Survival/Emergency Evacuation Manual. The information in her latest book has been the basis for workshops and seminars presented throughout the nation to groups including The American Red Cross, University Special Courses, corporate \"Brown Bag\" lunch workshops, Adult Continuing Education Programs, civic groups, clubs, churches, service, and profes- sional groups. As a frequent guest on the radio and television talk show circuit, she has appeared on the Phil Donahue Show, Gary Collins’ Hour Magazine, Sally Jesse Raphael’s Talk Show, as a regular with Vicki Law- rence, and as Consumer Specialist on the Great American Homemaker.

Notes 72-Hr.+ Emergency/Preparedness Action Kit \\uf0ae 13 \\uf071 Establishing a \"Care-In-A-Crisis\" plan is critical to all of your family members. \\uf071 Knowing what you must do about shelter, heat, and warmth. \\uf071 Don\\'t ignore the need for personal sanitation! \\uf071 Preparing properly with the exclusive Personal Planning Pages can make the differ- ence between panic and the ability to cope with an emergency situation. Often in the aftermath of natural or people-caused disasters, everyone taught that as much as 3 days (72 hours) lapses between the actual occurrence of the emergency and the arrival or availabil- ity of competent help. After the experiences of Hurricane Katrina and other cataclysms such as the Indonesian tsunami, we no longer adhere to that expectation. Depending on the gross amount of damages, the extent of the disaster’s footprint, and it geographic location, the response time for relief care of is extended to as much as 7-10 days before aid is organized and operating effectively. There are two other friends who are authors and specialist with solid information and expertise on the subject of preparedness. One of them is Rita Bingham, a preparedness issues author and natu- ral meals specialist. Preview her preparedness book, The New Passport To Survival––12 Steps to Self-Sufficient Living. Rita is also a long-time acquaintance, and her specialty lies in her know- ledge of nutrition and natural foods. Her books are available on her website: http://www.naturalmeals.com/passportnew.html. Another friend and expert is LeArta Moulton, author, and food storage specialist. LeArta has 30 years of extensive research on using whole foods, herbs, home remedies, and survival techniques. Go to her website to download natural and herbal information: http://www.livingwithbasics.com/foodstorage.html You alone may be responsible for the provision of adequate food, water, shelter, etc., for your very survival during the period of time it takes for the arrival of the emergency and disaster relief organ- izations! E/PAK –– SOME ESSENTIAL GUIDELINES To provide you and your family maximum protection in case of an emergency, your E/PAK–– whether for 72 hours or for several weeks––should meet these minimum requirements: \\uf0b7 Accessibility –– Keep your kit in sight near a strong exit doorway, where you can grab it on the way out. Don\\'t hide your kit or place it where it might get covered. \\uf0b7 Completeness –– Check your kit regularly to assure yourself everything your family needs for three days\\' survival––or longer––is in the kit and ready for use. \\uf0b7 Individuality –– Everyone in the family must have a backpack or portable system! You may not be together from the outset, or you could become separated by events. \\uf0b7 Personalization –– Use the lists in this book to check and re-check what you may need. Commercial and generic kits––even long supply lists––can’t presume to provide com- pletely for the unique needs of you and your family. Any kit you fail to design for your personal needs will just be someone else’s opinion of your needs. With experience, you will learn to make content adjustments to meet your changing needs. \\uf0b7 Portability –– Keep all kits light enough it can be carried without undue strain on your body––it may be useless if it can’t be carried by it intended user. Keep all kits tightly packed and as light as possible. \\uf0b7 Rotation –– Rotate food, water, batteries, and medications frequently, at least every 3 to 6 months, to keep all use by dates current. More frequent rotation for items stored in tem- peratures exceeding 70oF would be prudent. Check all clothing articles frequently to as- sure continuing fit. \\uf0b7 Utilization –– Make sure you can operate or effectively use all items in your E/PAK. Al- ways buy the best quality you can afford––your life could depend on what you have in your kit! Don\\'t weigh down your kit with stuff! \\uf0b7 Versatility ––Assure your kit contains supplies for an emergency staycation as well as for evacuation. You might not be able to evacuate. Notes 14 \\uf0aeYour Personal & Family E-PAK \\uf0b7 Waterproof –– Place all items inside individual freezer-quality Ziploc® or similar water- proof plastic bags. Protect all contents from water––whether humidity or floodwaters! TO LEAVE?… OR NOT TO LEAVE?… THAT IS THE QUESTION! Hopefully, most of you won’t ever need your E/PAK. However, being prepared for such an even- tuality is good to ease the mind. My personal desire is that I’ll never need my E/PAK for any emergency. Yet, it will always be in a special location in my home near a protected exit, filled with all the things I’d need for ―hunkering down‖ when a natural disaster, such as a wind, ice, or snows- torm, or a people-caused disaster causes a power outage. Lots of people tell me they plan to ―bug out.‖ Personally, I plan to stay at home unless a life- threatening disaster requires my departure. There is no place I want to go––except maybe to an expensive hotel. However, with my personal 72-hour kit, I could even endure a public shelter, if necessary. I’ve spent a weekend in a church recreation hall during an ice storm with several other families––it wasn’t too bad, except for the lack of privacy. I’ve also spent a few days at my par- ents’ home during several power outages––with all the kids, grandkids, and their collective dogs. But heading for the unfamiliar hills, living in the wilderness fraught with unknown dangers, chas- ing wild animals with switches, fending off others in a similar plight to mine––all the while trying to maintain an urban lifestyle does not seem a good option to me. The very thought of getting on the freeway or city streets during or following a disaster, competing for space with all those folks carrying handguns (even if they do have permits) and other nefarious weapons, is just a little frigh- tening. On the streets I know I cannot defend myself adequately. At home, I can maintain my inde- pendence as long as I have my personal provisions to sustain me until the crisis period is past. My personal plans in the case of a local disaster––such as an electrical failure––are to make the best of a bad situation, enjoy the intervention in my normally extra-long, tiring workday, and spend it with my wife (and the dog) in the ensuing peace and quiet––hoping the electricity will return–– but not too soon!. It would be a moment to take a long nap, pull out the IPod, pop the top of a can of sardines, get out the comfort foods and enjoy a belated vacation––savoring the quiet, and listen- ing to all those short-wave radio programs I’ve been wanting to listen to for ages… BUT, IF YOU MUST LEAVE... However, if you must leave home unexpectedly (perhaps like those in California who had to eva- cuate due to wildfires), be sure to have the following information ready to go with you: \\uf071 daily contact details for family members \\uf071 local reunion points \\uf071 out of area contacts \\uf071 pertinent family operating data Chart 3 (following section) is a series of charts for accumulating critical post-emergency and dis- aster information. Completing the charts provides you the opportunity to record what everyone in the family––and perhaps, emergency personnel––would need concerning the daily whereabouts of each family member and how they can be contacted. It might be appropriate to keep the less confidential information on the family bulletin board (in our house it’s the refrigerator door!), a copy in each E/PAK, and a copy in your wallet. It would be wise to send a copy to a trusted friend or relative, your attorney, CPA, or parents. Remember to update this information with all members of the family or group as contact numbers and locations change. Keep in mind that during times of natural or people-caused disasters, local telephone service is often disrupted. Therefore, each member of the household should have a cell phone, with the name, phone number, and address of a person designated as an out-of-area contact. (Note: long distance lines and cell phones may remain active during emergencies. These services will normally be restored before residential lines. If separated, each family member should call the designated out-of-area contact and communicate his particular situation within a certain period of time, report- ing his physical condition, his location, and other information as previously agreed upon. Keep adequate change in your E/PAK for making pay phone calls––if you can still find one! Small change will buy small items––if they are available.

Each parent is responsible for protecting himself, his family, and his property to the best of his ability and capability. \\uf0b7 Preparedness demands detail planning and preparing personal and family resources to be able to: (1) Respond to emergencies or disasters, (2) Mitigate the effects of emergencies an disasters, and (3) Recover from natural and people-caused emergencies and disasters that often become our personal disasters. \\uf0b7 Your preparedness level should exceed your risk level of the expected and unexpected emer- gencies or disasters in your particular geographic location. \\uf0b7 Being prepared requires learning about potential disasters and emergencies, knowing first aid, CPR, and other life-saving skills. \\uf0b7 Adaptability and independence are critical qualities to develop in one’s preparedness efforts. \\uf0b7 Unfortunately, self-reliance skills are not taught in public schools. Home-schooled children have the advantage in this category. Usually self-reliance skills are learned at the hands of a tough taskmaster––bad experience! \\uf0b7 There is no easy, quick-and-dirty, low- or no-cost way to become self-reliant. It requires work––truly meaningful effort in self-education, and often a demands a large measure of self- denial. \\uf0b7 Utilize all the knowledge you can gain to prepare for the disasters which could cause you and your family more than loss of your car, your property, or your crops. When designing your personal or family’s E/PAK, remember this essential preparedness pointer: There are no emergencies for those who are truly prepared! Notes --- Content from Copy of Fighting Fire --- DEPARTRMENT: AGRICULTURE Fighting fire Fire can cause serious damage on a farm. It can destroy crops and grazing for animals. People or animals can get injured or may even die in the fire. Only one match can destroy thousands of trees and large areas of farmland. z Most crop fires occur before or soon after harvesting. At this time the crops are usually ripe and dry and burn easily. When crops have lost their green colour,leaves wilt and the ears droop, fires can be expected. z If a fire breaks out in a barn, remove the unburnt material as quickly as possible to prevent the fire from spreading. z When the wind is blowing, especially in August, fires can start and spread very easily. & 2 How to prevent fires z Children should not play with matches. z Do not throw burning matches or cigarettes into dry grass, leaves, bushes or barns. z Do not throw cigarette stubs out of a car window. z Make sure that all fires are put out properly. z Use sand to put out a fire. z Do not make open fires in the veld. z Never light fires in the open during windy weather. z Never leave a fire without putting it out or asking someone to keep an eye. If you see a fire z If you see a veld fire, report it immediately to your neighbours and the local fire warden. Tell them exactly where the fire is. z Leave someone at home to give people information about the fire. If you have a radio or telephone, the lines must be kept open so that new information can be passed on as soon as it is received. z Go back immediately to the spot where you saw the fire. Take also basic equipment to fight the fire with. XXXXX XXXXX 3 z If you are not the landowner, inform him or her about the exact position of the fire. z When you arrive at the fire, organise the firefighters as soon as possible. If you have a radio keep the person on standby at home updated on the situation so that the fire warden and neighbours can be alerted. z If possible, take a notebook with you and write down the details of the fire. z Remove all farm animals and equipment to a safe place. z Throw water onto the fire as soon as possible. Tools (equipment) you can use to put out a fire z Hoses z Fire extinguishers—water or dry-powder type z Make fire swatters from old beltings (strips of rubber) or wet sacks. Beating the fire with the beltings or wet sacks takes away the air (oxygen) which the fire needs to burn. If there is not enough air, the fire will smother and die slowly. z Use rucksack pumps to wet the plants and grass near and in front of the fire. Rucksack pumps are also useful when checking for flare-ups after the fire has been put out. z Use water containers and a waterpump that can supply enough water. 4 z Shovels, rakes and spades can be used to make a firebreak quickly. A counter fire can be made from this break. A break is a clean strip of land, almost like a road. z Use shovels and rakes to put out the fire with sand and soil. Use them also to remove dry grass and twigs which can burn easily. z Use hand slashers to cut unburnt grass and plants before an oncoming fire. z Use fire swatters (leafy branches or sacks fitted to the end of wooden sticks). Food and water Arrange for food and drinking water to be taken to the scene of the fire for the firefighters. It is a good idea to keep a supply of food, such as dry biscuits, tinned food (bullybeef, beans in tomato sauce, tuna, tomatoes and onions), maize-meal and instant cold drinks ready in case of emergency. Remember that the firefighters can get very tired. 5 Fighting the fire z Do not allow too many people in the area. z The firefighters should work short shifts (periods). Those in front should be replaced at short intervals. z Approach the fire from one or both sides and try to narrow the front of the fire. z If there is a fire-belt (break) or a natural barrier such as a river, try to narrow the fire against the barrier. z Set upt firefighters at strategic placed to put out sparks carried by the wind. Strong wind can carry sparks as far as 1 km. z Use waterpumps to cool down the flames and to enable the beaters to reach the fire and put out the smouldering material. z It is important to beat inwards to the burning area so that sparks are not blown into grass and leaves that are not burning yet. z A clean break must be raked or hoed behind the firefighters to separate the burnt area from unburnt plants. Throw the leaves and grass that you have raked or hoed into the burnt area. z Monitor the wind direction at all times. z Carry a whistle. This may help you to give the firefighters basic signals. 6 Back-burning If the wind is very strong and it is impossible to stop the fire by direct beating, back-burning may be considered as a last resort. Back- burning can be very dangerous. A back-burn is a new fire from the opposite direction to meet the fire that is already burning. z It is very important to ensure that no-one comes between the fire and the back-burn. z Back-burn from the road, fire-belt or natural barrier well ahead of the fire. z Burn only a very narrow strip at a time and slowly widen the strip. z Do not let the back-burn fire flare up and throw sparks—rather dampen the grass and leaves with water, or put out the fire if it seems too dangerous, before continuing. Wind direction v Head fire v v v Back-fire Starting point v v v v v 7 When the fire has been put out Once the fire is put out, the following should be done: z Make sure that the firefighters have not been injured z Patrol the area for at least 3 hours to check for flare-ups z Return equipment to the correct place z Refill water containers such as tankers z Repair damaged equipment. 2002 Revised Compiled by Directorate Agricultural Information Services, Department of Agriculture Printed and published by Department of Agriculture and obtainable from Resource Centre, Directorate Agricultural Information Services Private Bag X144, Pretoria, 0001 South Africa 8 --- Content from Copy of Fire Safety --- Fire Safety and Extinguishers Types of Extinguishers With so many fire extinguishers to choose from, selecting the proper one for your home can be a daunting task. Everyone should have at least one fire extinguisher at home, but it\\'s just as important to ensure you have the proper type of fire extinguisher. Fire protection experts recommend one for the kitchen, the garage and workshop. Fire extinguishers are divided into four categories, based on different types of fires. Each fire extinguisher also has a numerical rating that serves as a guide for the amount of fire the extinguisher can handle. The higher the number, the more fire-fighting power. The following is a quick guide to help choose the right type of extinguisher. Class A extinguishers are for ordinary combustible materials such as paper, wood, cardboard, and most plastics. The numerical rating on these types of extinguishers indicates the amount of water it holds and the amount of fire it can extinguish. Class B fires involve flammable or combustible liquids such as gasoline, kerosene, grease and oil. The numerical rating for class B extinguishers indicates the approximate number of square feet of fire it can extinguish. Class C fires involve electrical equipment, such as appliances, wiring, circuit breakers and outlets. Never use water to extinguish class C fires - the risk of electrical shock is far too great! Class C extinguishers do not have a numerical rating. The C classification means the extinguishing agent is non-conductive. Class D fire extinguishers are commonly found in a chemical laboratory. They are for fires that involve combustible metals, such as magnesium, titanium, potassium and sodium. These types of extinguishers also have no numerical rating, nor are they given a multi-purpose rating - they are designed for class D fires only. Some fires may involve a combination of these classifications. Your fire extinguishers should have ABC ratings on them. Here are the most common types of fire extinguishers: Water extinguishers or APW extinguishers (air-pressurized water) are suitable for class A fires only. Never use a water extinguisher on grease fires, electrical fires or class D fires - the flames will spread and make the fire bigger! Water extinguishers are filled with water and pressurized with oxygen. Again - water extinguishers can be very dangerous in the wrong type of situation. Only fight the fire if you\\'re certain it contains ordinary combustible materials only. Dry chemical extinguishers come in a variety of types and are suitable for a combination of class A, B and C fires. These are filled with foam or powder and pressurized with nitrogen. o BC - This is the regular type of dry chemical extinguisher. It is filled with sodium bicarbonate or potassium bicarbonate. The BC variety leaves a mildly corrosive residue which must be cleaned immediately to prevent any damage to materials. o ABC - This is the multipurpose dry chemical extinguisher. The ABC type is filled with monoammonium phosphate, a yellow powder that leaves a sticky residue that may be damaging to electrical appliances such as a computer Dry chemical extinguishers have an advantage over CO2 extinguishers since they leave a non-flammable substance on the extinguished material, reducing the likelihood of re-ignition. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) extinguishers are used for class B and C fires. CO2 extinguishers contain carbon dioxide, a non-flammable gas, and are highly pressurized. The pressure is so great that it is not uncommon for bits of dry ice to shoot out the nozzle. They don\\'t work very well on class A fires because they may not be able to displace enough oxygen to put the fire out, causing it to re-ignite. CO2 extinguishers have an advantage over dry chemical extinguishers since they don\\'t leave a harmful residue - a good choice for an electrical fire on a computer or other favorite electronic device such as a stereo or TV. It is vital to know what type of extinguisher you are using. Using the wrong type of extinguisher for the wrong type of fire can be life-threatening. These are only the common types of fire extinguishers. There are many others to choose from. Base your selection on the classification and the extinguisher\\'s compatibility with the items you wish to protect. Fire needs fuel, oxygen and heat in order to burn. In simple terms, fire extinguishers remove one of these elements by applying an agent that either cools the burning fuel, or removes or displaces the surrounding oxygen. Fire extinguishers are filled with water or a smothering material, such as CO2. By pulling out the safety pin and depressing the lever at the top of the cylinder (the body of the extinguisher), this material is released by high amounts of pressure. How it Works At the top of the cylinder, there is a smaller cylinder filled with compressed gas. A release valve acts as a locking mechanism and prevents this gas from escaping. When you pull the safety pin and squeeze the lever, the lever pushes on an actuating rod which presses the valve down to open a passage to the nozzle. The compressed gas is released, applying a downward pressure on the fire-extinguishing material. This pushes the material out the nozzle with high amounts of pressure. Although the temptation is to aim the extinguisher at the flames, the proper way to use the extinguisher is to aim it directly at the fuel. Water Extinguishers Water extinguishers are filled with regular tap water and pressurized with oxygen. The best way to remove heat is to dump water on the fire but, depending on the type of fire, this is not always the best option. Dry Chemical Extinguishers Dry chemical extinguishers are filled with either foam or powder, usually sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) or potassium bicarbonate, and pressurized with nitrogen. Baking soda is effective because it decomposes at 158 degrees Fahrenheit and releases carbon dioxide (which smothers oxygen) once it decomposes. Dry chemical extinguishers interrupt the chemical reaction of the fire by coating the fuel with a thin layer of powder or foam, separating the fuel from the surrounding oxygen. Carbon Dioxide (CO2) extinguishers CO2 extinguishers contain carbon dioxide, a non-flammable gas, and are highly pressurized. The pressure is so great that it is not uncommon for bits of dry ice to shoot out. CO2 is heavier than oxygen so these extinguishers work by displacing or taking away oxygen from the surrounding area. CO2 is also very cold so it also works by cooling the fuel. Using Extinguishers Before using your fire extinguisher, be sure to read the instructions before it\\'s too late. Although there are many different types of fire extinguishers, all of them operate in a similar manner. Use this acronym as a quick reference (it is a good idea to print this reference and pin it next to your fire extinguisher): P A S S Pull the Pin at the top of the extinguisher. The pin releases a locking mechanism and will allow you to discharge the extinguisher. Aim at the base of the fire, not the flames. This is important - in order to put out the fire, you must extinguish the fuel. Squeeze the lever slowly. This will release the extinguishing agent in the extinguisher. If the handle is released, the discharge will stop. Sweep from side to side. Using a sweeping motion, move the fire extinguisher back and forth until the fire is completely out. Operate the extinguisher from a safe distance, several feet away, and then move towards the fire once it starts to diminish. Be sure to read the instructions on your fire extinguisher - different fire extinguishers recommend operating them from different distances. Remember: Aim at the base of the fire, not at the flames!!!! A typical fire extinguisher contains 10 seconds of extinguishing power. This could be less if it has already been partially discharged. Always read the instructions that come with the fire extinguisher beforehand and become familiarized with its parts. It is highly recommended by fire prevention experts that you get hands-on training before operating a fire extinguisher. Most local fire departments offer this service. Once the fire is out, don\\'t walk away! Watch the area for a few minutes in case it re-ignites. Recharge the extinguisher immediately after use. Maintaining Extinguishers Inspect fire extinguishers at least once a month (more often in severe environments). Fire extinguisher maintenance is important for everyone’s safety. If the extinguisher is damaged or needs recharging, replace it immediately! You must ensure that: The extinguisher is not blocked by equipment, coats or other objects that could interfere with access in an emergency. The pressure is at the recommended level. On extinguishers equipped with a gauge (such as that shown on the right), the needle should be in the green zone - not too high and not too low. The nozzle or other parts are not hindered in any way. The pin and tamper seal (if it has one) are intact. There are no dents, leaks, rust, chemical deposits and/or other signs of abuse/wear. Wipe off any corrosive chemicals, oil, gunk etc. that may have deposited on the extinguisher. Some manufacturers recommend shaking your dry chemical extinguishers once a month to prevent the powder from settling/packing. Fire extinguishers should be pressure tested (a process called hydrostatic testing) after a number of years to ensure that the cylinder is safe to use. Consult your owner\\'s manual, extinguisher label or the manufacturer to see when yours may need such testing. IMPORTANT: Recharge all extinguishers immediately after use regardless of how much they were used. An inspection is a “quick check” to give reasonable assurance that a fire extinguisher is available, fully charged and operable. The value of an inspection lies in the frequency, regularity, and thoroughness with which it is conducted. The frequency will vary from hourly to monthly, based on the needs of the situation. Inspections should always be conducted when extinguishers are initially placed in service and thereafter at approximately 30-day intervals. MAINTENANCE Fire extinguishers should be maintained at regular intervals (at least once a year), or when specifically indicated by an inspection. Maintenance is a “thorough check” of the extinguisher. It is intended to give maximum assurance that an extinguisher will operate effectively and safely. It includes a thorough examination and any necessary repair, recharging or replacement. It will normally reveal the need for hydrostatic testing of an extinguisher. Location of Extinguishers Having a fire extinguisher is one thing, having it handy in case of an emergency, is another. It is recommended to have at least one fire extinguisher on each floor of your home. Also, keep them in plain sight and no more than five feet above the floor. Do not put them in closets because that will cost you valuable time when you are reaching for it. And even though a fire extinguisher may not match your décor, do not put it behind curtains or drapes. The most important places to have a fire extinguisher are in areas that are more susceptible to fire. These areas are the kitchen and the garage. Kitchen: According to U.S. Fire Administration statistics, the kitchen is the place where fires most often start. If you have a fire extinguisher in the kitchen, most grease fires can be contained. Do not put the fire extinguisher near the stove as it will be out of your reach if the fire is on the stovetop. You should not have to risk burns just to reach your extinguisher. Therefore, the best place to put the fire extinguisher is by the door of the kitchen so you have easy access to it. Garage: It is a good idea to keep a fire extinguisher here because in most homes, this is the place we use as storage. Often, leftover paints, solvents, and building materials will be piled up without a second thought. Again, the best location to mount the fire extinguisher is by the door. Fire Prevention The National Fire Protection Association reports 85% of fire deaths occur in the home, making fire prevention a top priority in every home. Here is a list of some of the less obvious tips for fire prevention, based on the most common causes of fires: Cooking equipment Keep appliances clean, and wipe surfaces after spills. Clean stove surfaces and ovens regularly. Wear tight-fitting sleeves, or roll them up when cooking Keep flammable objects, including pot holders, dish towels and curtains, at least three feet away from the stove. Wood and coal stoves, fireplaces, chimneys, and all other solid-fueled heating equipment needs to be inspected annually by a professional and cleaned accordingly. Assure microwaves have enough room to breathe, that all the vents are cleared of obstructions. If there is a microwave fire, keep the door closed and unplug the microwave. Make sure to have the microwave oven serviced before you use it again. If there is an oven fire, keep the door closed and turn off the heat. If the fire doesn\\'t go out immediately, call the fire department. A grease fire occurs when oil or greasy foods are heated and ignite. The simplest way to fight a grease fire is to carefully slide a lid over the pan. Turn off the burner, don\\'t move the pan, and keep the lid on until the pan cools completely. Baking Soda may also be used to suffocate the fire. NEVER PUT WATER ON A GREASE FIRE. Water causes the grease to splatter and the fire to spread. Also, NEVER attempt to take a grease fire outdoors. It will be too hot to carry and you will drop it, causing a major house fire. Heating Equipment Heating equipment is the leading cause of home fires during the winter months of December, January and February, and is the second leading cause of home fires year round. When buying heaters, look for devices with automatic shutoff features. Be sure any gas-fueled heating device is installed with proper attention to ventilation, and never put un-vented gas space heaters in bedrooms or bathrooms. Liquefied Petroleum (LP) gas heaters with self-contained fuel supplies are prohibited for home use by NFPA codes. Never leave space heaters on when you leave the room. Space heaters should be kept at least three feet away from anything that can burn. Don\\'t use extension cords with space heaters. The high amount of current they require could melt the cord and start a fire. When lighting a gas space heater, strike your match first, then turn on the gas. Never use a gas range as a substitute for a furnace or space heater. Electrical Distribution Equipment Wiring, outlets, switches, circuit breakers and other electrical devices are the third leading cause of home fires and the second leading cause of fire deaths. Replace or repair loose or frayed cords on all electrical devices. If outlets or switches feel warm, shut off the circuit and have them checked by an electrician. Try to avoid extension cords. If you feel an extension cord is necessary, make sure that it is not frayed or worn. Do not run it under carpet or around doorways. Never overload a socket. The use of \"octopus\" outlets or \"power bar\", outlet extensions that accommodate several plugs, is strongly discouraged. Try to limit one high-wattage appliance into each individual outlet at a time. If a circuit breaker trips or a fuse blows frequently, cut down on the number of appliances on that line. In many older homes, the capacity of the wiring system has not kept pace with today\\'s modern appliances and can overload electrical systems. Some overload signals include: dimming lights when an appliance goes on, fuses blowing frequently or shrinking TV picture. Assure there\\'s plenty of air space around home entertainment units such as the TV and stereo to avoid overheating. Although some fires are caused by electrical system failures and appliance defects, many are caused by the misuse and poor maintenance of electrical appliances, incorrectly installed wiring, and overloaded circuits and extension cords. Other Sources Never smoke in bed. Always look under cushions and in trashcans for burning cigarettes before going to bed. Check carpeting where ashtrays have been used. Get rid of stored newspaper or other unnecessary materials. Newspapers stored in a damp, warm place may ignite spontaneously. Install smoke detectors on every level of your home and outside of sleeping areas. Mount a fire extinguisher in the kitchen, garage and workshop. Agree in advance on an escape plan. There should be at least two exits in every room. Note: Half of all home fire deaths occur at night, so fire hazard checks and special attention to fire prevention should occur before going to bed. Fighting a Fire All fires can be very dangerous and life-threatening. Your safety should always be your primary concern when attempting to fight a fire. Before deciding to fight a fire, be certain that: The fire is small and not spreading. A fire can double in size within two or three minutes. You have the proper fire extinguisher for what is burning. The fire won\\'t block your exit if you can\\'t control it. A good way to ensure this is to keep the exit at your back. You know your fire extinguisher works. Inspect extinguishers once a month for dents, leaks or other signs of damage. Assure the pressure is at the recommended level. On extinguishers equipped with a gauge, the needle should be in the green zone - not too high and not too low. You know how to use your fire extinguisher. There\\'s not enough time to read instructions when a fire occurs. How to Fight a Fire Safely: Always stand with an exit at your back. Stand several feet away from the fire, moving closer once the fire starts to diminish. Use a sweeping motion and aim at the base of the fire. If possible, use a \"buddy system\" to have someone back you up or call for help if something goes wrong. Be sure to watch the area for awhile to ensure it doesn\\'t re-ignite. Never Fight A Fire If: The fire is spreading rapidly. Only use a fire extinguisher when the fire is in its early stages. If the fire is already spreading quickly, evacuate and call the fire department. You don\\'t know what is burning. Unless you know what is burning, you won\\'t know what type of fire extinguisher to use. Even if you have an ABC extinguisher, there could be something that will explode or produce highly toxic smoke. You don\\'t have the proper fire extinguisher. The wrong type of extinguisher can be dangerous or life-threatening. There is too much smoke or you are at risk of inhaling smoke. Seven out of ten fire-related deaths occur from breathing poisonous gases produced by the fire. Any sort of fire will produce some amount of carbon monoxide, the most deadly gas produced by a fire. Materials such as wool, silk, nylon and some plastics can produce other highly toxic gases such as carbon dioxide, hydrogen cyanide, or hydrogen chloride. Beware - all of these can be fatal. Smoke inhalation or exposure to fire itself can be life threatening so get educated about the basics in CPR and burn treatment. --- Content from Copy of Flood Preparation --- Flood Preparation INTRODUCTION The Yukon government recognizes its responsibilities to aid and assist the public in preparing for and responding to disasters which threaten life and property. Local authorities and/or municipal governments respond first, but may call upon other levels of government to help. Every level of government has its share of responsibility for public safety and assistance to disaster victims. The Yukon’s Emergency Measures Organization helps municipalities develop and maintain a high level of emergency, preparedness and response. At one time or another residents in the Yukon may find that they, their family, home and property are threatened by one of a variety of natural disasters such as earthquakes, mud slides, tsunamis, violent storms or floods. This booklet is intended to provide information for use by individuals should their home be threatened by a flooding situation. The information provided represents general tips for consideration and is provided to help Yukoners be better prepared to deal with the perils of a flood.

Securely plug all basement drains and outlets such as: sewer drains, sinks, toilet bowls and laundry outlets to the sewer. It may be necessary to plug some outlets below the level of the weeping tile drains, in the primary sewer trap. Effective plugs can be made from wood or plastic bags. All plugs must be held in place by sandbags or other heavy materials, or held in place by braces securely fastened to floor joists. Move all possessions within the structure above the projected flood water level Prepare sandbag-wall around your property (see sandbag dykes) Remove lawn furniture Move smaller outhouses to higher ground and away from potentially eroding riverbanks. SANDBAG DYKES Construction of a sandbag dyke requires special procedures to achieve maximum strength and effectiveness. Should you choose to construct a sandbag dyke to protect your property in the event of a flood, the following tips may be useful. 1. Strip the sod or ground cover beneath the area for the proposed dyke and dig a \"bonding trench\" one sack in depth and two sacks wide as a foundation for the dyke structure. 2. To effectively provide protection from the forces of flooding water a dyke must be three times as wide at its base as it is high. A dyke intended to be one metre high must have a three metre wide base. 3. Sandbags should never be filled more than half-full and must be laid in alternating crisscross directions. The base level should be laid parallel to the flow of the water, the second level should be laid perpendicular to the flow, with the third level again laid parallel, continuing to the intended height of the dyke. Each successive layer is set back one-half sandbag width on both sides in each additional layer. A side view of a completed dyke would show a triangular cross section. 4. Individual bags need not be tied shut. Overlapping by successive bags will hold the sand in place. The method of keeping bag contents in place is called \"lapping.\" May 2007 - 4 - 5. As individual bags are put in place, each must be tamped firmly to ensure maximum performance and strength in the finished dyke.

This prevents foundation damage and allows room for people and equipment to move. As well, this space allows more dike base width to be constructed should additional dike height be required. \\x83 Lay first course/bottom layer of bags parallel to river/water with the closed side of bag against river flow direction. The filled portion of the second bag sits over the empty portion of the previously placed bag. This is known as lapping. River Flow May 2007 6 Drop the bags into place and tamp bags with feet to lodge them into place. Offset the bags from the previous row in the same course to form a brick pattern Second and remaining courses: Rotate bags 90 degrees when laying second course of sandbags. Keep seal side of bag towards water/river. Ensure sandbags are well packed against each other and firmly in place. Change direction of bag from parallel to perpendicular to the river for each course of bags. Every second course of sandbags should be set back a quarter (1/4) of a sandbag width, both on the river side and the land side of the dike, producing a step-like appearance. Weave the polyethylene sheet between the courses of sandbags as to have at least two layers of sandbags protecting the polyethylene sheet from debris punctures. Maximum depth of the polyethylene sheet should be 3 sandbags or a quarter (1/4) of the cross section of the dike, whichever is less. If more height of polyethylene sheet is required, make polyethylene sheets overlap at least two feet. May 2007 - 7 - Polyethylene Sheeting Flooding Above First Floor Level POLYETHYLENE SHEETING A reliable source of protection for the structure of your home and most other smaller buildings during severe flooding conditions is the proper use of polyethylene (plastic) sheeting. The following is a brief description of how, according to dyking engineers, an individual can provide protection to his or her home should potential flooding conditions be considered severe enough to require evacuation. This system has been successfully used throughout Canada and the United States, and is recommended for structures located in areas where flood depth is anticipated to extend above the level of the structure\\'s first floor. It is not considered necessary in areas where only basement flooding is expected. Polyethylene sheeting is intended to add extra protection to the building\\'s structure, but \"sheeted\" buildings are not considered suitable to live in once the sheeting has been completed. Use this procedure only if evacuation is anticipated. May 2007 - 8 - Procedure: The exterior lower levels of a home to be evacuated are wrapped in polyethylene sheeting, secured at joints with nailed strips of wood and anchored around the structure\\'s foundation with sandbags or other heavy objects. For greatest protection, the use of 6-mil polyethylene sheets in 3 metre widths is recommended. Step-by-Step Instructions: Should your home or other structures be located in an area where flooding above first floor level is forecast, you may wish to do the following: 1. Listen carefully to the forecast and determine how high the predicted flood level will be, then allow an extra metre of coverage beyond that height. 2. Remove all valuables from basement, turn off and disconnect all power and gas lines and remove all electric motors from the furnace and appliances which will remain in the basement during the flooding period. 3. Securely plug all basement drains and outlets such as: sewer drains, sinks, toilet bowls and laundry outlets to the sewer. It may be necessary to plug some outlets below the level of the weeping tile drains, in the primary sewer trap. Effective plugs can be made from wood or plastic bags. All plugs must be held in place by sandbags or other heavy materials, or held in place by braces securely fastened to floor joists. 4. Move all possessions within the structure above the projected flood water level. 5. Flood the basement with clear water from an outside tap through a basement window. Bring water level inside the basement to window casement level. 6. Board up all windows, doors and other openings. 7. For additional protection against the force of outside flood waters, brace the walls of the structure from the inside by nailing \"two-by-six\" lengths or planking one metre above the floor. Once the two-by-six \"walers\" are .in place, add braces constructed from strips of two- by-fours, running at a 45 degree angle from the \"walers\" to the floor and hold in place with either sandbags, or wooden blocks nailed directly to the floor. 8. Apply the polyethylene barrier loosely to the exterior walls of the structure, starting at a height of one meter above the predicted flood level. Allow an additional one metre at the base of the structure for anchoring. At joints in the sheeting, allow a minimum one metre overlap. Place sandbags around the house against the polyethylene. Stack the bags in an overlapping fashion and at least 10 bags high. 9. At the base of the first stack of sandbags lift the remaining polyethylene sheeting up and cover the outside face of the initial sandbags, hold the plastic sheeting in place with a second wall of sandbags.

Where basement windows are above ground level, treat as other openings. Note: This sketch describes a method of protecting an individual dwelling from flooding using polyethy|- ene and sandbags. Although the method has been successful, constant surveillance and maintenance of the emergency flood barrier is a requirement during the duration of the flood. This method is not recom- mended where the predicted crest extends 1.3 metres over the water level in the basement. RECOMMENDED METHOD FOR INDIVIDUAL DWELLING PROTECTION May 2007 - 10 - ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR HOUSEHOLDERS Additional considerations for householders to help prevent flood damage include: a. If eaves troughs are connected to the house sewer system, disconnect them and re- channel the flow to points more than 1.3 metres from the building\\'s foundations. This will help reduce the flow of water into the community sewage system.. b. Dangerous chemicals such as weed killer, insecticides and corrosives should be removed to dry areas to reduce the dangers of chemical contamination, fires, explosions and personal injuries.. c. Buoyant materials should be removed from the basement to lessen the potential for damage to first floor components of the structure should the basement flood.. If you plug the basement sewer, be sure to remove the toilet bowl from any basement bathroom and plug that sewer drain securely as well. If, through taste, colour or odour you suspect your drinking water is contaminated, do not drink it. Contaminated drinking water may be purified by boiling, by adding purification tablets (if available), or by adding household bleach. In most situations adding two drops of normal strength bleach to each litre of water is recommended. Allow the treated water to stand for at least 30 minutes before drinking. ELECTRICAL POWER In any area where immediate flooding is anticipated, it is essential to shut off all electrical power. In an urban area homeowners are advised to shut off the power by opening the main service switch. In a suburban or rural area the yard switch must be opened. Entry into a flooded room or basement where electrical power is believed to still be active should never, under any circumstances, be attempted. When disconnecting the power source it is essential to be standing on a dry platform. Avoid approaching any master switch if it is surrounded by water. The switch may be opened through the use of a non-conductive dry material such as a dry wooden stick or insulated tool of some sort. An additional precaution you are to consider if involved in rescue work, or if you are returning to property abandoned during a flood, concerns possible submerged electrical cables. In some flooded areas water levels may reach or submerge power bearing electrical cables. When operating a boat in flooded areas extreme caution must be exercised to avoid coming into contact with \"live\" wires. If your home is threatened by immediate flooding it is important not only to be prepared for the first line of flooding, but to make as many preparations as possible for the return to normal living once the flood has subsided. May 2007 - 11 - Some things to consider include: a. If appliances such as deep freezers, furnaces, washers and dryers can not be moved above the anticipated flood level, then electrical controls and motors, should be removed to prevent water damage and expensive repairs. If an electrical motor has been submerged in water no attempt should be made to operate it until a complete overhaul and cleaning has been completed. b. All insulation of thermally insulated appliances must be replaced before operation if the appliances have been partially or completed submerged. These appliances include: water heaters, refrigerators, freezers and ranges. (Note: With the present cost of parts and labour, repairs to such appliances may not be practical.) c. Electric baseboard heaters and portable heaters must be moved above water level. It is doubtful such items could be rendered safe for operation once submerged. d. Portable electric appliances such as kitchen blenders and mixers, as well as power tools must be kept dry, or not operated until completely dried, cleaned and overhauled. e. Radios, televisions, stereo systems and other home electronic systems must be moved above the flood level. Repairs to such items following submersion is not practical. In order to prevent fires or dangerous short circuits all wiring in homes and other buildings which have been partially or completely flooded must be inspected before being placed back in service. GAS FIRED APPLIANCES Ideally, if enough advance warning is provided of a potential flood, homeowners should have a professional contractor remove electric motor, burners and controls. If such help is not available, these are the steps you may wish to take: 1. Shut off the supply of all electrical power to the appliance and leave it off. 2. Shut off the gas supply valve to the appliance. These valves are usually in the gas line near the bottom of the appliance. 3. On warm air circulating furnaces remove the electric fan motor and, if possible, the fan unit as well. 4. For a hot water circulating system, remove the circulating pump motor, but do not try to remove the pump unit from the piping system. May 2007 - 12 - 5. If advance warning time allows for the removal of gas fired clothes dryers, ranges and other such appliances it is essential to shut off the gas valve. It is also essential to cap the open end of the pipe leading from the valve to the appliance to prevent the back flow of flood water into the gas piping system. This may be accomplished by using plugs or pipe caps available at most hardware and plumbing stores. 6. If the hot water tank cannot be moved, do not drain. Shut off pipes leading to and from it and leave it in place. Once the flood waters have subsided, do not attempt to place gas appliances back in service yourself. This work must be carried out by a licensed pipe fitter. OIL FIRED APPLIANCES As in the case of gas appliances, all work in preparing for a flood should be carried out by a professional. If this is not possible, here are some steps you may take to protect your home and property. 1. Shut off electrical supply to all equipment and leave it off. 2. Remove the oil burner and ignition transformer, or, if possible, remove the entire burner unit. If the complete burner unit is removed, cap the copper oil fuel line to ensure it is water tight. Turn off the fuel line at the tank. 3. For forced air furnaces, remove the fan motor and the fan unit, if possible. 4. On hot water boilers equipped with a circulating pump, remove the pump motor, but do not attempt to remove the pump from the piping system. 5. Remove the controls for the stack, high limit and fan. 6. If the height of the flood waters exceeds the top of the tank, damage may result as the floating tank exerts pressure on floor joists and components to the building above. To prevent this consider the following: a. Remove oil level gauge and plug opening with the proper sized threaded plug. b. Fill the tank with oil. c. Place at least 136 kg of weight on top of the tank. Sandbags are ideal. If the tank is only half filled, a minimum of 544 kg of sandbags will be required. d. As previously noted, shut off valve at the base of the tank. May 2007 - 13 - PROPANE TANKS Although located outside the structure, propane tanks can cause damage, potential for devastating explosions if ruptured and exposed to a spark. Such tanks are costly to replace as well. Because propane is considerably less dense than water, even a full tank is extremely buoyant. Secure anchoring is a necessity for flood conditions. Here are some steps for you to follow: 1. Turn off the valve at the tank. 2. Disconnect tubing to tank and securely plug it. 3. Fasten a cable, heavy rope or chain around the tank and secure the other end to a pole, building or substantial structure to prevent the tank from floating away. Once the flood waters have gone down, call a propane installer to have the tank properly and safely re-installed and connected to the appliances for which it is a fuel source. Do not attempt to do the re-connection yourself. IF YOU MUST LEAVE YOUR HOME If rising flood waters threaten the safety of you and your family and you must evacuate your home, here are some things you may wish to consider: 1. Ensure that each member of your family has warm clothing and waterproof outer wear. 2. Take waterproof footwear for each family member. 3. Make sure each family member has at least one blanket, rolled in plastic sheeting or a plastic shopping bag. 4. Ensure each family member has identification, especially the young children. Name tags on clothing, wallet cards and wrist bands are all useful. 5. Seal all personal documents and family papers in plastic. 6. Take a supply of all essential medications, especially for those on prescription drugs, for each member of the family. You should always maintain a minimum two week supply of prescription drugs. 7. Carry all items necessary for the care and feeding of any infants in the family, including diapers, feeding bottles and foods. May 2007 - 14 - 8. Bring hand towels and toiletry items for each person. 9. Take an AM transistor radio with extra batteries and a flashlight with extra batteries. 10. Determine a location to move to before leaving and make sure each family member knows where it is. Provide younger children with a note sealed in plastic stating the family\\'s destination. This will reduce problems should the family be separated for any reason. As you leave your home remember to do the following: 1. Lock all doors and windows and double check to ensure gas and other heating fuel sources are turned off, electricity is disconnected and the water is shut off at the main valve leading to the house. 2. Take extra care when driving. Familiar roads will appear drastically different when covered by flood waters. 3. Be on the lookout for damaged bridges, slides and washouts and be particularly alert for downed power lines. 4. Be alert for emergency personnel and signs providing evacuation route directions. 5. Obey officials who are directing traffic or involved in rescue or flood control operations. They are there to assist you and to make sure the situation is handled safely and effectively. RETURNING HOME Do not return home until emergency operations headquarters announces the emergency situation is over. Before returning make sure there is a safe water supply and adequate sewage disposal system in operation. If you are in doubt, contact the local health unit office. If your home is in an area served by a public water supply it is quite possible safe drinking water will be available. For detailed information concerning the potential contamination of food stuffs contact your local health unit. As a general rule, avoid possible health hazards by not eating food contaminated by (submerged in) flood waters. Health officials recommend disposal of the following food stuffs: NON-LIQUID FOODS, including dried fruits; cereals; flour; shortenings; spices; packaged goods; meats (fresh and cured); May 2007 - 15 - CANNED GOODS (if damaged and showing signs of seepage); BOTTLED FOOD PRODUCTS (including home preserves and home canned goods); bottled drinks (potential for contamination to gather under the rippled edge of the caps); and LEAFY VEGETABLES AUTOMOBILES, TRUCKS, FARM EQUIPMENT- DIESEL OR GAS If time allows, move all vehicles, recreational vehicles, farm equipment and other modes of transportation with gasoline or diesel engines to high ground. Flood control headquarters and the local media will provide up-to-date information concerning anticipated flood crests. If the equipment can not be moved, then seal it as much as possible. Some considerations include: 1. Drain all oil and replace with SAE 30, MS or DG, run engine for approximately 10 to 15 minutes. 2. Remove spark plugs and place one or two tablespoons of oil in each cylinder; re-install the plugs. 3. Remove the starter, alternator, carburetor, coil and battery. 4. Seal all openings, including distributor, carburettor, oil filter, air intake and exhaust. Use polyethylene tied tightly where possible, wooden plugs, rubber plugs or tightly wadded polyethylene. 5. Transmissions are well sealed against water, but secure any breather vents, filler tubing or air vents with plugs. 6. Cover exterior of transmission with heavy grease. Clutch plates should be left released. 7. Carry out as thorough a grease job as possible. May 2007 - 16 - Once the waters have subsided the following procedure will reduce the damage caused by water intake to the engines: 1. Start the engine as soon as possible after the waters have receded, and allow to run for 10 to 15 minutes, or until normal operating temperature is reached. Drain the engine oil and replace the filter. Refill with SAE 30, MS or DG. Start and run for another 10 to 15 minutes to circulate oil to all internal moving parts, drain this oil, replace filter and refill once again. 2. Remove and re-pack all sealed bearings. 3. Coat all exposed wear parts with a good quality multipurpose grease. 4. Have vehicle serviced by a reliable mechanic as soon as possible. PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY Although there are many municipal, territorial and federal agencies ready to provide aid should a devastating flood occur in Yukon, it is the personal responsibility of each of us to be prepared to deal with disaster should it unexpectedly strike. Agencies from all levels of government can do their jobs more efficiently, if each one of us takes personal responsibility for preparedness. Preparing ourselves, our families and being ready to help our neighbors will help to reduce the devastating effects of disasters. Ensure your family knows and practices the Family Emergency Plan, knows where the Basic Emergency Kit is located, as well as its contents. May 2007 - 17 - Prepare Your Family Emergency Plan Escape routes – all family members and guests should know escape routes from (include maps where possible): o Home o From neighborhood Determine a predestinated meeting place Special health needs – updated list of medications (with a two-week supply of medications and medical supply Location and contents of grab-and-go bag Plan for what to do with pets Any special risk to your location or family members (guests) An out-of-town contact – that all members of family are aware of An out-of-territory contact - that all members of family are aware of List of family contact numbers – work numbers for phone and cell, radio frequencies, others Location of fire extinguishers Basic Kit Water – at least two liters of water per person per day.

Courtesy of James T. Stevens ********* SPECIAL NOTE ***** SPECIAL NOTE ***** SPECIAL NOTE ******** This Version 3.0 update of the Prudent Food Storage FAQ includes a first time event. An increasing number of people have been asking for a printed and bound copy of the FAQ, apparently as a response to the Year 2000 computer problem and other Millennial concerns. With the aid of my partner, Bob Hollingsworth, we have formatted, printed and bound Version 3.0 to honor these requests. Naturally, since we have spent a good deal of our time and a not inconsiderable amount of our cash in doing this we are not giving it away for free, but are charging $15.00 (US) per copy plus $3.00 shipping and handling (US Postal Service Priority Mail). My postal address may be found below and at the end of this file, or you may e-mail me. This print edition will be available for only for a limited time. The reason for this is that I am presently at work on \"The Prudent Pantry: Your Guide to Building A Food Insurance Program\", my first commercial work. When completed it will contain all of the content of this FAQ plus a good deal more that I don\\'t presently cover such as storage program planning, inventory control, storage locations, the best foods to store, grain mills & other equipment, water storage and purification along with expedient sanitation. At this time I am not ready to give either a firm publication date or cover price for *The Prudent Pantry*, but I am hoping for early spring of 1999. When it is ready to go to press I will stop printing bound FAQ copies. Due to the ever growing size of the work (presently over 300k) I can no longer post the FAQ to the Usenet. I will, of course, continue to make the FAQ updates available online via host sites on the World Wide Web even after the book hits the street.

Its purpose is to promote an understanding of the methods and techniques used to extend the nutritive and palatability shelf lives of those foods most suitable for use in food storage programs. There is commonality between food storage and food preservation even though they are not precisely the same thing. Some of the information here may be found in greater or lesser detail in the *rec.food.preserving* (r.f.p) FAQ compiled by Leslie Basel. If you want the how-to\\'s of drying fruit, making jerky, canning beans, fermenting pickles or corning beef, I refer you to her work and the good stuff to be found there. In this compendium you will be taken through the ins and outs of how to put away your storage foods and have a reasonable expectation of getting something edible back out of the container when you finally use them. Also covered will be food spoilage -- how to recognize it and how to combat it. A resource list detailing where to find supplies and further information is included at the end. This file is updated as sufficient material becomes available. Be of assistance -- point out mistakes, contribute data or information, write reviews, or provide us with new sources.

Since the entire idea of a food storage program is that it should be available for \"you and yours\" in times of need, it is important to understand the conditions that can affect the edibles stored in your pantry. A storage program is only as good as the quality of the food that goes into it. It cannot get any better than what originally went in, but it can certainly get worse. In the fullness of time, all stored foods will degrade in nutrient content and palatability until they reach the inevitable end where even the dog won\\'t eat them. It\\'s because of this eventuality that every article, book, and teacher concerned with putting food by gives the same advice: *Date all food containers and rotate, Rotate, ROTATE. The first food in should be the first food out.* This concept is often shortened to the acronym FIFO. The reason for this emphasis on stock rotation is that when discussing the usefulness of foodstuffs there are really two shelf lives to be considered. The first is the nutrient content of the food. This actually begins to fade at the moment of harvest. Three factors dictate nutritional shelf life: The food\\'s initial nutritional content; the processing and preservation steps it underwent; and its storage conditions. Eventually the nutrition will dwindle away to nothing. At some point you will have to decide whether the remaining nutrition is worth the space the food is taking up and if it should be rotated out of storage. The second shelf life is a food\\'s palatability life or the point at which undesirable changes occur to its taste, texture, color and cooking qualities. This is the reason for the \"use by\" and \"sell by\" dates on many foods and for shelve lives in general. It will almost always be in excess of good nutritive life. If you don\\'t have anything to replace it with, it\\'s not necessary to throw food out just because it\\'s reached the end of its best palatable storage life. Do, however, keep in mind that advancing age will only further decrease the useful nutrition, increase the foods\\' unattractiveness and enlarge the chances that something may cause the food to spoil. Within reason, the key to prolonging the shelf life of your edibles lies in lowering the temperature of the area they are stored in. The storage lives of most foods are cut in half by every increase of 18 deg. F (10 deg. Celsius). For example, if you\\'ve stored your food in a garage that has a temperature of 90 deg. F, you should expect a shelf life less than half of what could be obtained at room temperature (70 deg. F) this in turn is less than half the storage life that you could get if you kept them in your refrigerator at 40 deg. F. Your storage area should be located where the temperature can be kept above freezing (32 deg. F) and, if possible, below 72 deg. F. Ideally, your storage location should have a humidity level of 15% or less, but unless you live in the desert it\\'s not terribly likely you\\'ll be able to achieve this. Regardless, moisture is not good for your stored edibles so you want to minimize it as much as possible. This can be done by several methods. The first is to keep the area air-conditioned and/or dehumidified during the humid times of the year. The second is to use packaging impervious to moisture and then to deal with the moisture trapped inside. If you are able, there\\'s no reason not to use both. All containers should be kept off the floor and out of direct contact from exterior walls to reduce the chances of condensation. Another major threat to your food is oxygen. Chances are that if you have it sealed in moisture-proof containers then they are probably air-tight as well. This means that the oxygen can also be kept from doing its damage. If no more can get in, your only concern is the O2 that was trapped in the container when it was sealed. Lowering the percentage of O2 to 2% or less of the atmosphere trapped in the packaging (called head gas) can greatly contribute to extending its contents shelf life. The three main tactics for achieving this are vacuum sealing, flushing with inert gas or chemically absorbing the oxygen. Any one or a combination of the three can be used to good effect. Once you have temperature, humidity and oxygen under control, it is then necessary to look at light. Light is a form of energy and when it shines on your stored foods long enough it transfers some of that energy to the food. This has the effect of degrading its nutritional content and appearance. Fat soluble vitamins, such as A, D and E are particularly sensitive to light degradation. It certainly is a pretty sight to look at rows and rows of jars full of delicious food, particularly if you were the one that put the food in those jars. However, if you want to keep them at their best, you\\'ll admire them only when you turn the light on in the pantry to retrieve one. If you don\\'t have a room that can be dedicated to this purpose then store the jars in the cardboard box they came in. This will protect them not only from light, but help to cushion them from shocks which might break a jar or cause it to lose its seal. For those of you in earthquake country, it\\'s a particularly good idea. When \"terra\" is no longer \"firma\" your jars just might dance right off onto the floor. Assuming they were properly processed in the first place, canned, dried and frozen (never thawed) foods do not become unsafe when stored longer than the recommended time, but their nutrient quality fades and their flavor goes downhill. Following these rules of good storage will keep your food wholesome and nutritious for as long as possible: 1 - First In, First Out (FIFO) means rotating your storage 2 - Cooler is better 3 - Drier is better 4 - Less oxygen exposure means more shelf life. 5 - Don\\'t shed light on your food. Think of rotating your food storage as paying your food insurance premiums -- slacking off on rotation cuts back on your coverage. Is your food insurance up to date? ========================================================================= -- II -- THE TECHNIQUES OF FOOD STORAGE ========================================================================= In this section will be covered a number of foods that are particularly suited to being included in storage programs along with the various forms they can be found in and specific tips for a number of different food categories. A. GRAINS AND LEGUMES A.1 GRAIN VARIETIES One of the most important decisions in planning a food storage program is what kinds of grains to include, but many people do not give this adequate thought. Some just buy however much wheat or corn or rice they think is necessary to meet their needs and leave it at that. Others rely on pre-packaged decisions made for them by their storage food retailer who put together a \"year\\'s supply of food\" to buy all at once. Either decision could be a major mistake. There are a number of food storage plans one may use as a guide. Many are based on the so-called \"Mormon Four\" of wheat, milk, honey and salt, with as many additional foods as the planner found to be desirable. When it was created in 1937, this plan may have been OK, but we\\'ve learned a great deal since then. An unfortunate number of people in our society develop allergies to one kind of food or another. One of the more common food allergens is wheat. Even more unfortunate is the fact that many people who have an allergy to wheat don\\'t even know it. They won\\'t become aware of it until they try to live with wheat as a large part of their diet. For this reason you should store what you eat and eat what you store, so that ugly surprises such as this don\\'t come up when it\\'s too late to easily avoid them. A second reason to think about storing a selection of different grains is appetite fatigue. There are those who think providing variety in the diet is relatively unimportant and that if and when the time comes they\\'ll eat what they\\'ve got and that will be that. For healthy, well-adjusted adults under ordinary circumstances this might be possible without too much difficulty. However, the entire reason for having a food storage program is for when circumstances aren\\'t ordinary. Times of crisis produce stress -- possibly physical, but always mental. If you are suddenly forced to eat a diet both alien and monotonous, it is going to add just that much more stress on top of what you are already dealing with. If your planning includes the elderly, young children and/or infants they might just quit eating or refuse to eat sufficient amounts and become unable to survive. This is not a trivial problem and should be given serious consideration. Consider the positive aspects of adding some comfort foods. In his book, *Making the Best of Basics*, James Stevens mentions a post-WWII study by Dr. Norman Wright, of the British Food Ministry, which found that people in England and Europe were more likely to reject unfamiliar or distasteful foods during times of stress than under normal conditions. When it\\'s wheat, day in and day out, wheat\\'s going to start becoming distasteful fast. Far better to have a variety of foods on hand to forestall appetite fatigue and, more importantly, to use those storable foods in your everyday diet so that you\\'ll be accustomed to them. [If anyone knows where I may find an actual copy of the study by Dr. Wright, I\\'d appreciate it if you\\'d point me to it. Thanks- ed.] ABOUT GLUTEN: As you read through the grains descriptions below you will come across frequent mention of \"gluten\". Gluten is the protein in grains that enables the dough made from them to trap the gasses produced by yeast fermentation or chemical reaction of baking powder or soda and in turn causes it to rise. The amount of this protein to be found in species of grains and varieties within a species can vary radically. Some grains such as rice have virtually no gluten at all and will not produce a raised loaf by itself while others like hard winter wheat have a great deal and makes excellent raised bread. Whether gluten content is of importance to you will depend upon the end uses you intend for your grain. Some of the common and relatively uncommon types of grains and their varieties are listed below. AMARANTH: Amaranth is not a true cereal grain at all, but is a relative of the pigweeds and the ornamental flowers we call \"cockscomb\". It\\'s grown not only for its seed, but for its leaves that can be cooked and eaten as greens. The seed is high in protein, particularly the amino acid lysine which is limited in the true cereal grains. It can be milled as-is, or toasted to provide more flavor. The flour lacks gluten, so it\\'s not suited for raised breads, but can be made into any of a number of flat breads. Some varieties can be popped much like popcorn, or can be boiled and eaten as a cereal, used in soups, granolas, and the like. Toasted or untoasted, it blends well with other grain flours. BARLEY: Barley is thought by some to be the first grain ever grown by man. It has short, stubby kernels with a hull that is difficult to remove. Excluding barley intended for malting or animal feed, most of this grain is consumed by humans in two forms. Most common is the white, highly processed \"pearl barley\" with much of its bran and germ milled off along with its hull. It is the least nutritious form of barley. The second offering is called \"pot\" or \"hulled barley\" and it has been subjected to the same milling process as pearled, but with fewer trips through the polisher. Because of this, it retains more of the nutritious germ and bran. Unless you are prepared to try to get the hulls off I don\\'t recommend buying unhulled barley. Although it can be milled into flour, its low gluten content will not make a good loaf of raised bread. It can be combined with other flours that do have sufficient gluten to make leavened bread or used in flat breads. Barley flour and flakes have a light nutty flavor that is enhanced by toasting. Whole barley is commonly used to add thickness to soups and stews. Recently, a hull-less form has become available on the market through a few suppliers. This is whole grain barley with all of its bran and germ intact and should have the most nutrients of any form of this grain available. I have not yet been able to discover yet how suitable it is for long term storage. BUCKWHEAT: Buckwheat is another of those seeds commonly considered to be a grain, but which is not a true cereal. It is a close relative to the docks and sorrels. The \"grain\" itself is a dark, three cornered seed resembling a tiny beechnut. It has a hard, fibrous hull requiring a special buckwheat huller to remove it. Here in the U.S., it is most often used in pancakes, biscuits and muffins. In Eastern Europe and Russia it is known in its toasted form as \"kasha\". In the Far East, it\\'s often made into \"soba\" or noodles. It\\'s also a good bee plant, producing a dark, strongly flavored honey. The flour is light or dark depending on how much of the hull has been removed before grinding. Dark flour is much more strongly flavored than lighter flour, but because of the high fiber and tannin content of its hull it is not necessarily more nutritious. Buckwheat is one of those foods with no middle ground in peoples opinions -- they either love it or they hate it. Like amaranth, it\\'s high in lysine, an amino acid commonly lacking in the true cereal grains. CORN: Corn is the most common grain crop in the U.S., but it is (maize) mostly consumed indirectly as animal feed or even industrial feedstock rather than directly as food. As one of the \"Three Sisters\" (corn, squash and beans) it was the staple grain of nearly all of the indigenous peoples of the American continents before the advent of European colonization. It comes in an amazing variety of forms with some being better suited for a particular purpose than others. The varieties intended to be eaten as fresh, green corn are very high in sugar content and do not dry or store well. The other varieties are the flint, dent, flour, and popcorns. All of them keep well when they have been properly dried. To a certain extent, they\\'re all interchangeable for purposes of grinding into meal (sometimes known as polenta meal) or flour (very finely ground corn, not cornstarch), but some make better meal than flour and vice versa. As a general rule of thumb, the flint varieties make better meal as they have a grittier texture than the other corns. If meal, hominy and hominy grits (commonly called just \"grits\") are what you are most interested in, use the flint type. If you intend to make corn masa for tortillas and tamales, then the flour type is what you want, but it is seldom found on the commercial market so the dent type is next best. Popcorn is what you need if you want to pop it for snacks and it can also be ground into meal or flour. It seems to me it makes a very good meal, but it\\'s a bit gritty for flour. It\\'s also difficult to hull it with alkali treatment. Your mileage may vary. Yellow dent corn seems to be the most commonly available variety among storage food dealers and will work fine for almost any purpose but popping. Popcorn is one form of a whole grain available to nearly everyone in the U.S. if they know where to look. It is so popular as a snack food, particularly in movie theaters and events like fairs and ball games, that even the smallest of towns will generally have at least one business selling it in twenty-five or fifty pound bags. Since it\\'s meant to be eaten it\\'s safe for food. To be at its most \"poppable\", this corn needs to have a moisture content between 13.5%-15.5% which makes it just a little too moist for ideal storage. A small amount of drying will need to be done before it\\'s packed away. If wanted for popping later, it can always be re-hydrated by sprinkling a tablespoon of water per quart of kernels, shaking vigorously and allowing it to be absorbed for a day or two. If you still get too many \"old maids\" or unpopped kernels then repeat the process once more. Popcorn is harder than the other varieties of corn so if your mill is not of the heavy duty sort you may want to consider cracking the popcorn into coarse pieces first then grinding into finer textured meal. Once you\\'ve decided between flint, dent or popcorn, (the flour types are difficult to find commercially) you now have to decide upon it\\'s color: There are yellow, white, blue, & red dried varieties. The yellow and white types are the most common by far with the blues and reds mostly being relegated to curiosities, though blue corn has been gaining in popularity these last few years. It should be kept in mind that white corn does not have the carotene (converts into vitamin A) content of yellow corn. Since vitamin A is one of the major limiting vitamins in long term food storage, any possible source of it should be utilized. For this reason I suggest storing yellow rather than white corn. Additionally, much of the niacin content of corn is chemically bound up in a form not available for human nutrition unless it has been treated with an alkali. This is really of importance only if 85% or more of your daily calorie intake will come from corn, but grits, hominy or corn masa (for tortillas and tamales) are traditional uses for this grain and can go a long way toward increasing the number of recipes you can make with it. Give them a try, they\\'re really quite good. MILLET: Millet is an important staple grain in North China and India, but is little known as a food in the U.S, where we mostly use it as bird feed. The grain kernels are very small, round, and usually ivory colored or yellow, though some varieties are darker. The lack of gluten and a rather bland flavor may account for the anonymity of this grain but it has a more alkaline pH than other grains and makes it very easy to digest. It also has a higher iron content than any other grain but amaranth. It swells a great deal when cooked and supplies more servings per pound than any other grains. When cooked like rice it makes an excellent breakfast cereal. It has little gluten of its own, but mixes well with other flours. OATS: Though the Scots and the Irish have made an entire cuisine from oats, it is still mostly thought of in the U.S. as a bland breakfast food. Seldom found as a whole grain, it\\'s usually sold processed in one form or another. Much like barley, oats are a difficult grain to separate from their hulls. Besides its longtime role as a breakfast food, oats make an excellent thickener of soups and stews and a filler in meat loafs and casseroles. Probably the second most common use for oats in America is in cookies and granolas. A little creative thought can really increase their culinary range. Listed below in order of desirability for storage are the forms of oats found in this country. Rolled and cut oats retain both their bran and their germ. Oat groats: These are whole oats with the hulls removed. They are not often found in this form, but can sometimes be had from natural food stores and some storage food dealers. Oats are not the easiest thing to get a consistent grind from so producing your own oat flour takes a bit of experience. Steel cut oats: Also known as Irish, pinhead or porridge (but so are rolled) oats. These are oat groats which have been cut into chunks with steel blades. They\\'re not rolled and look like coarse bits of grain. This form can be found in both natural food stores (sometimes much cheaper) and many supermarkets. Rolled oats: These are also commonly called old fashioned, thick cut or porridge oats. To produce them, oat groats are steamed and then rolled to flatten. They can generally be found wherever oats are sold. They take slightly longer to cook than do the quick cooking oats, but they retain more flavor, texture and nutrition. This is what most people will call to mind when they think of oatmeal. Quick cooking rolled oats: These are just steamed oat groats rolled thinner than the old fashioned kind above so that they will cook faster. They can usually be found right next to the thicker rolled oats. Instant rolled oats: These are the \"just add hot water\" or microwave type of oat cereals and are not particularly suited for a storage program. They do, however, have uses in \"bug out\" and 72 hour food kits for short term crises. Whole oats: This is with the hulls still on. They are sold in seed stores and sometimes straight from the farmer who grew them. Unless you have some means of getting the hulls off, I don\\'t recommend buying oats in this form. If you do buy from a seed supplier, make certain that they have not been treated with any chemicals that are toxic to humans. QUINOA: Quinoa is yet another of the grains that is not a true cereal. It\\'s botanical name is Chenopodium quinoa (pronounced \"keen-wah\"), and is a relative of the common weed Lambsquarter. The individual kernels are about 1.5-2 mm in size and are shaped rather like small flattened spheres. When quinoa is cooked, the germ of the grain coils into a small \"tail\" that lends a pleasant crunch. This exotic grain should be thoroughly washed before cooking in order to prevent it from tasting bitter. There are several varieties of quinoa that have color ranging from near white to a dark brown. The larger white varieties are considered superior and are the most common. RICE: Rice is the most commonly consumed food grain in the world. The U.S. is the leading exporter of it, though we actually only produce about 1% of the global supply. The majority of the world\\'s rice is eaten within five miles of where it was grown. Much like wheat and corn, rice comes in a number of varieties, each with different characteristics. They are typically divided into classes by the length of their kernel grains; short, medium and long. Short grain rice: The short grain variety is a little softer and bit moister when it cooks and tends to stick together more than the longer rices. It has a sweeter, somewhat stronger flavor than long grain rice. Medium grain rice: The medium grain variety is not very common in the States. It has flavor like the short variety, but with a texture more like long. Long grain rice: The long grain variety cooks up into a drier, flakier dish than the shorter types and the flavor tends to be blander. It is the most commonly found size of rice on American grocery shelves. Each of the above may be processed into brown, white, parboiled or converted and instant rice. Below is a short discussion of the differences between the various types. Brown rice: This is whole grain rice with only the hull removed. It retains all of the nutrition and has a pleasant nutty flavor. From a nutritional standpoint it is by far the best, but it has one flaw: The essential oil in the germ is very susceptible to oxidation and soon goes rancid. As a result, brown rice has a shelf life of only about six months from the date of purchase unless given special packaging or storage. Freezing or refrigeration will greatly extend this. It\\'s possible to purchase brown rice from long term food suppliers already specially packaged in air tight containers with an inert nitrogen atmosphere or you can do it yourself. In this kind of packaging, (if properly done), the storage life can be extended for several years. Converted rice: Converted rice starts as whole rice still in the hull which undergoes a process of soaking and steaming until it is partially cooked. It is dried, hulled and then polished to remove the bran and germ. The steaming process drives some of the vitamins and minerals from the outer layers into the white inner layers. This makes it more nutritious than polished white rice, but also makes it more expensive. Its storage life is the same as regular white rice. White rice: This is raw rice that has had its outer layers milled off, taking with it about 10% of its protein, 85% of its fat and 70% of its mineral content. Because so much of the nutrition is lost, white rice sold in the U.S. has to be \"enriched\" with vitamins to partially replace what was removed. Instant rice: The type of rice is fully cooked and then dehydrated needing nothing more than the addition of water to reconstitute it. In a pinch, it\\'s not even necessary to use hot water. It\\'s not particularly suitable for inclusion in storage programs, but it does have a place in \"seventy-two hour\" and other short-term emergency kits. The white variety is by far the most common, but in the last few years instant brown rice has made an appearance on the market. RYE: Rye is well known as a bread grain in the U.S. It has dark brown kernels longer and thinner than wheat, but less gluten. Bread made from this grain tends to be somewhat dense unless gluten is added (often in the form of a lot of wheat flour) with color that ranges from pale to dark brown. German pumpernickel, made with unrefined rye flour and molasses, is the darkest, densest form. SORGHUM: Sorghum is probably more widely known here in the States for the syrup made from it. Also known as \"milo\", it is one of the principle cereal grains grown of Africa. Its seeds are somewhat round, a little smaller than peppercorns, of an overall brown color with a bit of red and yellow mixed in. The varieties called \"yellow endosperm sorghum\" are considered to have a better taste. It is a major feed grain in the Southwestern U.S. and is where the vast majority of the national production goes. Like most of the other grains, sorghum is low in gluten, but the seeds can be milled into flour and mixed with higher gluten flours or made into flat breads, pancakes or cookies. In the Far East, it is cooked and eaten like rice, while in Africa it is ground into meal for porridge. It\\'s also fermented for alcoholic beverages. TRITICALE: Triticale is not a creation sprung from the smooth brows of *Star Trek* script writers. It is, in fact, a cross or hybrid between wheat and rye. This youngest of grains combines the productivity of wheat with the ruggedness of rye and has a high nutrition value. The kernels are gray-brown, oval shaped larger-than-wheat and plumper than rye. It can be used in much the same way as either of its two parents. It will make a raised bread like wheat does, but the gluten is a bit weak so wheat flour is frequently added to strengthen it. Because of the delicate nature of its gluten, excessive kneading must be avoided. Although it is the youngest of the grains, it\\'s been around for decades, but has curiously never achieved much popularity. Whether this is for reasons of agricultural production or public acceptance I don\\'t know. WHEAT: Wheat comes in a number of different varieties. Each variety is more suitable for some purposes based on its characteristics. The most common classifications for its varieties are spring or winter, hard or soft, red or white. The hard wheats have kernels that tend to be small, very hard and with high gluten contents. Low gluten wheat does not produce as fine a loaf as high gluten wheat, though it can still be used for yeast breads if necessary. As a general rule, hard varieties have more protein than soft varieties. The soft wheats have kernels tending to be larger, plumper and softer in texture than hard wheats. Their gluten content is less and are used in biscuits, pastries, quick breads, pastas, and breakfast cereals where a higher gluten content would contribute an undesirable tougher texture. Winter wheats are planted in the fall, over winter in the field and are harvested the next summer. Spring wheats are planted in the early spring and are harvested in the fall. Red wheats comprise most of the hard varieties while white wheats comprise most of the soft. Recently, hard white wheats have been developed that are very suitable for raised bread making. Some feel the hard white varieties make a better tasting whole wheat bread than the hard red. The hard red varieties, either spring or winter, are the most commonly stored because of their high protein and should have no less than 12%. The hard white spring wheats are still relatively new and are not yet as widespread. They have the same excellent storage characteristics as the hard red wheats. A.2 LEGUME VARIETIES Unless you are willing to spend a great deal of money on preserved meats, a food storage program not including a large quantity of legumes is simply incomplete. There are few non- animal foods that contain the amount of protein to be found in dried beans, peas, and lentils. The varieties commonly available in this country have protein contents ranging from 20%-35%. As with most non-animal proteins, they are not complete in themselves for purposes of human nutrition, but become so when they are combined with the incomplete proteins found in grains. It is for this reason that grains and legumes are so often mentioned together. In cultures all over the world, it is common to find the two served together at a meal, making a complete protein, even when those doing the serving have no scientific understanding of nutrition at all. The legume family, of which all beans, peas, lentils, and peanuts are a part, is one of the largest in the plant kingdom. Because of this and the many thousands of years of development and cultivation that man has given them, the variety of edible legumes available to us is huge. Both the appearance and the names of these varieties are colorful and varied. They range from \"adzuki beans\", a type of soybean from the Orient, to \"zipper peas\", a commonly found field-pea here in the Southern U.S. Their color can range from a clean white, to deep red, dull green to flat black with thousands of mixtures and patterns of colors. In spite of this incredible variety of names and colors, legumes are largely interchangeable in cooking usage, although some dishes just wouldn\\'t be the same if a different type were used. Below is a partial list of some of the more commonly eaten bean varieties here in the U.S. BLACK BEAN: Also known as \"turtle beans\", these small, dark brownish-black, oval-shaped beans are well known in Cuban black bean soup. They are very commonly used in Central and South America and in China. They tend to bleed very darkly when cooked so they are not well suited to being combined with other beans, lest they give the entire pot a muddy appearance. BLACK-EYED PEA: Although there is tremendous variation among the many varieties of field-peas eaten throughout the Southern United States, it is black-eyed peas that are the most commonly known nationwide. The coloring of field-peas is as varied as the rest of the legume family, with black-eyed peas being small, oval- shaped with an overall creamy color and, of course, their distinctive black-eye. Dried field-peas cook very quickly and combine very tastily with either rice or cornbread. CHICKPEA: Also known as the \"garbanzo bean\" or \"cecci pea\" (or bean), it tends to be a creamy or tan color, rather lumpily roundish and larger than dried garden peas. Many have eaten chickpeas, even if they\\'ve never seen a whole one. They are the prime ingredient in hummus and falafel and are one of the oldest cultivated legume species known, going back as far as 5400 B.C. in the Near East. KIDNEY BEANS: Just like the rest of the family, kidney beans can be found in wide variety. They come in both a light and dark red color in their distinctive kidney shape. Probably best known here in the U.S. for their use in chili, they figure prominently in Mexican, Brazilian and Chinese cuisine. LENTILS: Lentils are an odd lot. They don\\'t fit in with either the beans or the peas and occupy a place by themselves. Their shape is different from the other legumes being roundish little discs with colors ranging from muddy brown, to green to a rather bright orangish-red. They cook very quickly compared to the larger beans and have a distinctive flavor. They are much used in Far Eastern cuisine from Indian to Chinese. LIMA BEANS: In the Southern U.S., they are also commonly called \"butter beans\". They are one of the most common legumes found in this country in all manner of preservation from the young small beans to the large fully mature type. Their flavor is pleasant, but a little bland. Their shape is rather flat and broad with colors ranging from pale green to speckled cream and purple. PEANUTS: The peanut, commonly known outside the U.S. as the \"groundnut\", is not actually a nut at all, but a legume. They are another odd species not much like the more familiar beans and peas. Whatever their classification peanuts are certainly not unfamiliar to U.S. eaters. Peanuts have a high protein percentage and even more fat. They are one of the two legume species commonly grown for oilseed in this country, and are also used for peanut butter, and boiled or roasted peanuts. Many Central and South American, African and Chinese dishes incorporate peanuts so they are useful for much more than just a snack food or cooking oil. PINTO BEANS: Anyone who has eaten Tex-Mex food has probably had the pinto bean. It is one of the most commonly eaten beans in the U.S., particularly in the Southwestern portion of the country. Stereotypically bean shaped, it has a dappled pattern of tans and browns on its shell. Pintos have a flavor that blends well with many foods. When ground together with white or navy beans they make my favorite home-made version of falafel. SOYBEANS: An entire university could be founded on the culinary and industrial uses of the soybean. It is by far the legume with the highest protein content in commercial production as well as being the other legume oilseed alongside the peanut. The beans themselves are small, and round with a multitude of different shades. Because of their high oil content, they are more sensitive to oxygen exposure than other legumes and precautions should be taken accordingly if they are to be kept for more than a year in storage. Although the U.S. grows a very large percentage of the global supply, we consume virtually none of them directly. Most of them go into cattle feed, are used by industry or exported. What does get eaten directly has usually been processed in some fashion. Soybean products range from tofu, to tempeh, to textured vegetable protein (TVP) and hundreds of other uses. They don\\'t lend themselves well to just being boiled until done and eaten the way other beans and peas do. For this reason, if you plan on keeping some as a part of your storage program (and you should) you would be well served to begin to learn how to process and prepare them now when you\\'re not under pressure to produce. That way you can throw out your mistakes and order pizza, rather than having to choke them down, regardless. A.3 TYPES OF AVAILABILITY OF GRAINS AND LEGUMES Grains and legumes of all types may be purchased in a number of different fashions depending largely on where you live and what time of year it is. The following will cover the various steps in the processing chain where they might be found starting with the forms most immediately suitable for storage and progressing all the way back to the farmer. Each type of availability has its good and bad points. As you might expect, the more processing the product receives, the higher its price is likely to be. The further back along the processing chain you go the cheaper the product should become in terms of purchase price. It will, however, cost you more in time and effort to get it into a condition ready to put it into storage. The easiest and simplest way to incorporate grains and legumes into your storage program is to purchase your items \"pre-cleaned and pre-packaged\". This is grain or legumes that have been harvested, cleaned and put up in bags or other containers-possibly even going so far as to already be packaged for long-term storage. If you don\\'t live in the area where they are grown, it is probably your only option. If you want to purchase in bulk then you may be able to find \"pre-cleaned\" which means that it has been passed through fans, screens or sieves to remove chaff, smut balls, insect parts, mouse droppings and other debris. It probably won\\'t be in any form of packaging and you may have to provide your own container. There may be minimum purchase amounts as well. If the moisture content is in the right range then nothing will need to be done other than to put it up in your own storage packaging. Be certain to make sure it is intended for human food use, otherwise read the cautionary text below. Should you happen to live in the area where the type of grain or legume that you are interested in purchasing is grown you may be able to purchase direct from the producer or distributor. If you are interested in doing this, it may be possible to find your product \"field-run\" which means that it\\'s been harvested and sold shortly thereafter. It will not have been given any cleaning or processing and is likely to be rather dirty depending upon the conditions under which it was grown and harvested. A second form called \"field-run from storage\" is product that has been harvested and then put into storage for a time. It will have all of the dirt and detritus of field run grain and whatever it may have picked up from the silo as well. IMPORTANT NOTE: If you have purchased your grains and legumes from a foods dealer then you needn\\'t worry about hidden mold infections, fungicides or insecticides that are unsafe for human consumption. In the U.S., the products will have been checked several times by Federal and State agriculture departments and probably by the major foods dealers as well, to ensure its quality. This is not necessarily the case when you purchase your grains or legumes directly from the farmer or elevator operator as field-run or field-run from storage grain. Nor is it necessarily the case if you\\'ve made the decision to utilize grains marketed as animal feed. Inspection procedures vary from nation to nation, so if you buy outside of the U.S. inquire of your supplier. If you are buying your grains and legumes from some place other than a foods dealer, you need to know the history of what you are buying. There is the remote possibility that field-run from storage or any grade of grain not specifically sold for human consumption may have had fumigants, fungicides or insecticides not certified as safe for human foods added while it was in the bin. It is important to know what it has been treated with before you buy it. Straight field-run grain, other than being dirty, is not likely to have had anything added to it that would make it undesirable for human consumption. There is, however, the also remote possibility it may have been infected with fungi that would make it unsafe for eating. One of these fungal infections of grain is called \"ergot\". This fungal disease affects the flowering parts of some members of the grass family, mostly confined to rye. Consuming the fungus causes a nervous disorder known as St. Anthony\\'s Fire. When eaten in large quantities the ergot alkaloids may cause constriction of the blood vessels, particularly in the extremities. The effects of ergot poisoning are cumulative and lead to numbness of the limbs and other, frequently serious, symptoms. The fungus bodies are hard, spur like, purple-black structures that replace the kernel in the grain head. The ergot bodies can vary in size from the length of the kernel to as much as several times as long. They don\\'t crush as easily as smut bodies of other funguses. When they are cracked open, the inner broken faces can be off-white, yellow, or tan. The infected grain looks very different from ordinary, healthy rye grains and can be spotted easily. Ergot only rarely affects other grains and will generally afflict rye only when the growing conditions were damp. If you purchase field run rye, you should closely examine it first for the presence of ergot bodies. If you find more than a very few, pass up that grain and look elsewhere. Ergot is typically not a common problem in the U.S and is easily spotted when it does occur. Other grain fungi, however, are much harder to spot and also have serious consequences should they be consumed. The various species of \"Aspergillus\" and \"Fusarium\" molds can be a problem almost anywhere and should be kept in mind. *Please see Section III.B Molds In Grains and Legumes for more information concerning this.* Sometimes grain in the form of animal feed or seed grain/legumes is available. Keep in mind animal feeds may have a higher contaminant level than what is permissible for human consumption. Under certain circumstances, the USDA allows the sale of grain or legumes for animal feed that could not be sold for direct human food use. It may even be mixed varieties of one grain and not all one type. Seed grains, in particular, must be investigated carefully to find out what they may have been treated with. It is quite common for seed to have had fungicides applied to them, and possibly other chemicals as well. Once treated, they are no longer safe for human or animal consumption. If you do purchase field-run grain of any sort, examine it closely for contamination and moldy grain. Ask the farmer or distributor whether it has been tested for mold or \"mycotoxin\" (fungal toxin) content. This is especially the case if you are buying field-run CORN, RYE, SOYBEANS or RICE. When you purchase direct from the field, you may be getting it before it has been checked. Be certain of what it is that you are getting and ask questions if you choose to go this route. Know who you are dealing with. Unless you just can\\'t find any other source, I don\\'t recommend using animal feed or seed grains for human food. *Please see section III.B.3 \" Molds In Grains and Legumes\" for further information.* A.3.1 MOISTURE CONTENT The moisture content of the grain or legume you want to put by has a major impact on how long you will be able to keep it in storage and still remain nutritious and edible. Some of the available literature states that grain with a moisture content as high as 13% can be safely put up, but there is a risk to keeping it at that moisture level that should be understood. The outside of every kernel of grain and bean you buy or grow hosts thousands of fungi spores and bacteria. This is all perfectly natural and is not a reason for alarm. The problem lies in that at moisture levels between 13.5% to 15% some fungal species are able to grow and reproduce. Aerobic bacteria (needing free oxygen to survive) require moisture in the 20% range. If you have grain with a moisture content as high as 13% you are perilously close to having enough moisture to enable mold growth which could lead to the spoilage and loss of your product. For this reason, I suggest you keep all grains and legumes to a moisture content of no more than 10%. An exception to this is raw peanuts which are particularly susceptible to an Aspergillus mold growth that produces aflatoxin (a type of mycotoxin) and should be stored with an 8% moisture content or less. If you do not have a clue as to what the moisture level of your grain is here are several methods to determine it. The first method requires a great deal more oven time, but is the simplest and has less room for error to creep in. The second method is much quicker, but greater care must be taken to prevent mistakes. Highly precise moisture content measurements generally require equipment and facilities beyond the scope of what can be had by the average person. It is still possible though to make some determinations that will be of real use for our purposes. You\\'ll need some way to measure weight with a fair degree of accuracy. The better the scale you use, the more reliability you\\'ll have in your determinations. Provided that it will weigh accurately to the half-ounce or less, any scale that can be calibrated with a known check weight will do. Even postal scales can be made to serve if they are carefully calibrated against a known weight. Many individuals interested in starting storage programs may have grain weight scales used in ammunition reloading that might serve well. Also necessary is a thermometer capable of withstanding and accurately measuring oven temperatures. As many bakers can tell you, home oven thermostats are often notoriously inaccurate so it is better to rely on a decent thermometer. Most kitchen supply stores can supply one that is oven safe and will accurately measure to the degree Fahrenheit or Celsius. Proper technique calls for preheating the oven for a half-hour or more before starting the dehydrating process so that it will be of a uniform heat throughout. The sample pan should be placed on the middle rack as close to the vertical and horizontal center of the oven as possible. The bulb or dial of the thermometer should be placed next to the pan. METHOD ONE. This method is for measuring moisture content in whole grains and legumes. Grain flours or meals, milk powders and any other finely textured foods should use method two detailed below. To be done prior to measuring -- choose a shallow heat resistant container that has a close fitting lid. Clean it thoroughly and dry it completely in your oven for 10-15 minutes. Allow it to cool and then weigh it carefully. This will give you the tare weight or what your container weighs empty. Depending on how your scale is calibrated you can use a smaller sample size than what is indicated below. Using the twenty-ounce sample mentioned in the following text will allow for fairly accurate readings with the average postal scale. A scale that will measure to the gram could use as small a sample as 20 grams. A powder scale could use even less, but the smaller your sample size becomes the more finicky care you must take not to allow error to creep in. Keep your sample size large enough to easily work with. Allowing for the weight of the sample pan, measure out a weighed twenty-ounce representative sample of the grain or legumes in question. Ideally, you should mix the entire lot thoroughly immediately before removing the sample, but if this is not possible then take it from the middle center of the container. It is important that you use care in this measurement since it will affect all following determinations. Put the sample in the container making sure it is not more than an inch deep. Place it in the oven with the lid off and allow to heat. Below is a table giving the oven temperatures and times per grain or legume type: Time and Temperature Settings for Determining Moisture Contents of Whole Seeds. ------------------------------------------------------ Oven Temperature Oven Time Seed Deg. F C Hours Barley 266 130 20 Beans 217 103 72 Corn 217 103 72 Oats 266 130 22 Rye 266 130 16 Sorghum, millet 266 130 18 Soybeans, peanuts 217 103 72 Wheat, rice 266 130 19 When the dehydration period is over place the close fitting lid on the sample pan and allow to cool in the oven with the door closed. Remove the pan and carefully weigh it. A one ounce loss in weight indicates your grain has a roughly five percent moisture content, 2 ounces indicates that it has a 10% moisture content, etc., etc. You might even be able to cut it as fine as a half oz loss, but I wouldn\\'t try to take it further than that. Obviously, this is only a rough measure, but it works and can be done with postal or dietetic scales that are available virtually everywhere. As I mentioned above, if you have a scale with a finer calibration it is possible to use a smaller sample size and achieve the same result. If anyone has a better way of measuring moisture levels which can be done without a lab or special equipment I\\'d surely like to hear it. METHOD TWO This method is much faster to use than the first, but greater care must be taken to prevent error. It can be used to determine moisture contents of whole grains and legumes, flours, meals and various food powders. The same equipment as was used in Method One will be required here as well as a low-RPM grain mill or some other device that can reduce a quantity of the grain to a meal consistency with only minimal heating of the sample. If the food to be tested is already at a meal consistency or finer then it can be used as-is. Grind a quantity of product you want to measure the moisture content of. Take care to grind the sample slowly enough to keep friction heat build up to a minimum or else moisture will be lost due to heat evaporation before it can be weighed. Immediately upon finishing the grinding, weigh out your sample so as to minimize unmeasured moisture loss. Place the sample in the oven and dehydrate in the manner used in Method One for a period of two hours at a temperature setting of 275 deg. F (135 deg. C). When the heating period is finished cover with the tight-fitting lid and allow to cool in the oven. Remove and weigh carefully. Moisture determination is the same as above. A.3.2 CLEANING IT YOURSELF If you\\'ve chosen to purchase field-run grain or if the pre-cleaned product you\\'ve bought isn\\'t clean enough, you can do it yourself. The fastest and easiest method is \"fanning\", a form of winnowing. This is done by pouring the grain slowly through the air stream of a fan or blower into a clean, deep container such as a cardboard box or trash can. The wind blowing through the falling grain will blow out most of the broken kernels, chaff, smut balls, mouse droppings, etc. If you\\'re losing too much good grain, try turning the fan down or moving it further back from the container. The deep container will cut down on the amount of kernels that bounce out. Repeat fanning as necessary until the grain is clean enough to suit or you\\'ve blown all of the lighter contaminants out. If the fanning didn\\'t get the grain clean enough it can be further cleaned by running it through a screen or sieve. This should be made with holes just big enough to pass an average sized grain of what it is you\\'re cleaning. Obviously, the size of the holes will necessarily vary depending upon the kernel size of the grain. Should the kernels still not be clean enough to suit then you\\'ll just have to resort to hand picking out the offending particles. I\\'d strongly suggest doing this just prior to grinding where it can be done in small batches rather than trying to do your entire storage all at once. It\\'s much easier to do a few pounds at a time than fifty or a hundred. If you have it in mind to wash the grain, this should not be done prior to storage, but, rather, just before use. After it\\'s been rinsed, it should be dried immediately in the oven by placing it no deeper than 1/2 inch and heated at 150 deg. F for an hour. It should be stirred occasionally to improve drying. A.4 STORING GRAINS AND LEGUMES Now that you have properly prepared your grains and legumes for storage, they are ready to be packaged. *For methods and procedures of packaging please see section IV.* IV. Specific Equipment Questions A. Storage Containers B. CO2 and Nitrogen C. Oxygen Absorbers D. Desiccants E. Diatomaceous Earth B. DRY MILKS Got milk? In the refrigerator, right? Milk is a great source of essential amino acids and vital calcium, but in its fresh liquid form it is a highly perishable commodity. Fortunately, milk can be found in several forms that lend themselves to food storage. The various types of dry milks are the best suited to the task. B.1 TYPES OF DRY MILKS NONFAT: This is pasteurized skim milk reduced to a powdered concentrate. It can be found in two forms, regular and instant. They are both made from milk in a spray-drying process, but the instant variety has been given further processing to make it more easily soluble in water than regular dry milk. Both types have the same nutrient composition. The regular variety is more compact and requires less storage space than the instantized variety, but it is more difficult to reconstitute. The most easily found variety is the instant, available in nearly any grocery store. The regular variety has to be sought out from baking and restaurant suppliers and storage food dealers. It takes 3.2 oz or about 3 tablespoons of instant nonfat dry milk added to 8 oz of water to make 1 cup of milk you can drink or cook with just like fresh milk, albeit with a considerable flavor difference. Combining the dry milk with water at least several hours before you plan to use it gives it time to dissolve fully and to develop a fresher flavor. Shaking the fluid milk vigorously will incorporate air and will also help to improve flavor. Add the powder to baked goods, gravies, smoothies, hot cereals, casseroles and meat loaf as a nutrition booster. It can also be used to make yogurt, cheese and most any cultured dairy product that does not require a high fat content. FLAVORED NONFAT: This may be found packaged in a variety of forms from a low calorie diet drink (artificially sweetened) to the other end of the scale, as cocoa mix or malted milk. The key ingredient is the dry milk so buy and store these products accordingly. WHOLE MILK: This is whole dry milk with all of its fat content and therefore has a shorter shelf life than nonfat. Other than that, it can be used in exactly the same way. Dry whole milk is difficult to find, but can sometimes be found where camping and outback supplies are sold. BUTTERMILK: Dry buttermilk is for use in recipes calling for buttermilk. Since it has a slightly higher fat content than nonfat dry milk, it generally does not keep as long. B.1.1 BUYING DRY MILK PRODUCTS (a)- Be sure the dry milk you are buying has been fortified with vitamins A and D. All of the nonfat dry milks I\\'ve seen come fortified with these two vitamins. The dry buttermilk does not come this way, at least the SACO brand does not. I don\\'t know if the flavored mixes and the dry whole milk do or not. (b)- There should be no artificial colors or flavors. I believe it is illegal to add preservatives to any dry milk sold in the U.S. so a claim of \"no preservatives\" on the label is of no consequence. Other nations may be different, however. (c)- \"Extra Grade\" on the label indicates the manufacturer has held to higher processing and quality standards and the milk is somewhat lower in fat, moisture and bacterial content, is more soluble, and has fewer scorched particles. There are still some manufacturers of dry milk that sell ordinary Grade A product, but they are becoming fewer. Every brand of instant powdered milk in my local grocery store is the Extra Grade, even the generic store brand. This, too, may vary outside of the States. (d)- Try to buy your dried milk in containers of a size that makes sense for the level of consumption in the household. Once it is opened, powdered milk has a short shelf life before undesirable changes in flavor and nutrient content occurs. If you buy large packages and do not use much at one time, consider breaking it down and repackaging into smaller containers at the time of purchase. (e)- As with any storage food you buy, try to deal only with reputable dealers. It is particularly important to do this with dry milk because of its short shelf life and sensitivity to storage conditions. Check expiration dates, then date and rotate packages. B.2 STORING OF DRY MILKS Dry milk products are probably the most sensitive to environmental conditions storage foods there are, particularly to temperature and moisture content. Their vitamins A and D are also photosensitive and will break down rapidly if exposed to light. The area where your dry milk is stored should be kept as cool as possible. If it is possible to do so, air-conditioning or even refrigeration can greatly extend the nutrient shelf life. If the storage container is transparent or translucent then it should be put into a second container opaque to light or stored in a dark room. Dry milk will absorb moisture and odors from the air so storage containers should be impervious to both air and moisture. The drier it can be kept, the better it will keep. The use of desiccants is an excellent idea. Oxygen also speeds decomposition. Powdered milk canned with nitrogen or carbon dioxide to replace air (which contains oxygen) will keep longer than powdered milk exposed to air. Vacuum canning also decreases the available oxygen. If the dry milk purchased was not packaged for long term storage then it should be repackaged right away. I purchase the instant variety at my local grocery and repack it when I get it home. I\\'ve seen a number of methods used for this and any of them should work. The method I now use is to pour the powder into clean, dry half-gallon canning jars. Once the jars are filled I add a small desiccant pack and seal. They are dated and stored in the ubiquitous cool, dark place. They must be guarded against breakage, but they offer the advantage of not holding odors, thus allowing for reuse after suitable cleaning. Since they are as transparent the contents must be protected against light. Vacuum sealing and then storing in a dark place may be the best method. Larger jars of 1 gallon size could be used and then re-vacuum sealed after each use. An O2 absorber would take care of any remaining oxygen and would, itself, last longer when used in conjunction with the vacuum sealer. Being glass, the jar can be reused as well as the lid and ring if they\\'re properly cleaned. Clean, sound plastic one and two liter soda bottles can also be used, but probably should be used just once since the plastic is somewhat permeable and will hold odors. If you have access to a can sealer, 10 cans make wonderful storage containers for dry milk, particularly if used in conjunction with O2 absorbers. Another method I\\'ve seen used is to remove the paper envelopes of milk powder from the cardboard box they come from the grocery store in and to put them in dated plastic bags. These bags are not sealed. The unsealed bags are then placed in a larger, air tight, opaque container. I\\'ve heard of plastic buckets, fifty cal and 20 mm ammo cans being used for this purpose. A healthy quantity of desiccant was also placed in the container. This would be another area where O2 absorption packets should serve well. It\\'s important to remember the containers should be clean and odor-free. *Please see Section IV Specific Equipment Questions for information concerning the proper use of containers, desiccants, compressed gasses, dry ice and oxygen absorbers.* B.2.1 SHELF LIFE OF DRY MILKS From: SacoFoods@aol.com (Amy Thompson) To: Dunross@dkeep.com (Alan Hagan) Subj: SACO Mix\\'nDrink Instant Pure Skim Milk Date: May 9, 1996 Dear Mr. Hagan: Thank you for your e-mail today and for your interest in SACO Mix\\'nDrink Pure Skim Milk. Our Mix\\'n Drink will keep its nutrition value for up to about two years if kept cool and dry, and the only vitamins that actually decrease over time are the vitamins A and D. These are not shelf-stable vitamins and are sensitive to heat and light. A good rule of thumb to follow is that the vitamins A and D will dissipate at a rate of about 20% every year if stored properly. The less heat and moisture the milk is exposed to, the better the vitamins will keep. A freezer could extend the shelf life, as long as the powder does not get moisture in it. If you had to put a time limit on the Mix\\'nDrink, for rotation purposes, I would date it at two years after the date of purchase. After opening a package of dry milk, transfer the powder to a tightly covered glass or metal container (dry milk can pick up odors from plastic containers) and keep it in the refrigerator. Unsealed nonfat dry milk keeps for a few months; dry whole milk for a few weeks. ------------------------------------------------------------------- From: SacoFoods@aol.com (Amy Thompson) To: Dunross@dkeep.com (Alan Hagan) Subj: SACO Mix\\'nDrink Instant Pure Skim Milk Date: May 21, 1996 Dear Mr. Hagan: Since vitamins A and D are heat and light sensitive, I would say that your 1 1/2 year shelf life is very reasonable. If you are trying to determine when the nutritional value has been affected more than 40%, as you previously indicated, you should be pretty safe with that time element, as long as it is not exposed to extreme heat. [Eds note: We were discussing the higher average temperatures found in Florida and other hot climates and the effect that it would have on their dry milk\\'s nutrient content] C. CANNED GOODS C.1 CANNED MILK TYPES Preserved liquid milk comes in a number of forms, none of which are very similar to each other. The most common forms of these packaged milks are as follows: CANNED MILKS: These are commonly called UHT milks (Ultra High Temperature) for the packaging technique used to put them up. They come in the same varieties as fresh liquid milks: Whole, 2%, 1% and skim. I\\'ve even found whipping cream in UHT packaging (Grand Chef - Parmalat), though this may be offered only in the commercial and restaurant trade. In the U.S. they have vitamin D added. The lesser fat content milks do not keep as long as whole milk and their use by dates are correspondingly shorter term. This milk is packaged in aseptic containers, either cans or laminated paper cartons. It has the same composition as fresh milk of the same type, and can be stored at room temperature because of the special pasteurizing process used. The milk has a boiled flavor, but much less than evaporated milk. The dates are usually for approximately six months. The milk is still usable past its date, but the flavor soon begins to go stale and the cream separates. I am told by a friend who lived in Germany not long after this kind of canned milk began to come on the market there that they were dated for a year. With a six-month shelf life this type of canned milk naturally requires a much faster rotation cycle than other types. The only brand name for this milk I\\'ve seen is Parmalat. Recently, I have discovered that it makes excellent yogurt, losing the boiled tasted EVAPORATED: This is made from fresh, unpasteurized whole milk. A vacuum-heating process removes 60% of the water; the concentrate is heated, homogenized, and in the States vitamin D is added. It is then canned and heated again to sterilize the contents. It may also have other nutrients and chemical stabilizers added. A mixture of one part water and one part evaporated milk will have about the same nutritional value of an equal amount of fresh milk. There is generally no date or use by code on evaporated milk Health and nutrition food stores often carry canned, evaporated goat\\'s milk, in a similar concentration. SWEETENED CONDENSED: This milk goes through much less processing than evaporated milk. It starts with pasteurized milk combined with a sugar solution. The water is then extracted until the mixture is less than half its original weight. It is not heated because the high sugar content prevents spoilage. It\\'s very high in calories, too: 8 oz has 980 calories. Although it is often hard to find, the label has a stamped date code which indicates the date by which it should be consumed. Sweetened, condensed milk may thicken and darken as it ages, but it is still edible. C.1.1 SHELF LIFE OF CANNED MILKS Unopened cans of evaporated milk can be stored on a cool, dry shelf for up to six months. Canned milk (UHT) should be stored till the stamped date code on the package (3 - 6 months). Check the date on sweetened, condensed milk for maximum storage. C.2 CORROSION PREVENTION OF CANNED GOODS Some areas have difficulty storing metal canned goods for long periods of time. This is usually caused by very high humidity or exposure to salt in a marine environment. If this is a problem, it is possible to extend the life of metal cans by coating their outsides. I\\'ve seen this used on boats here in Florida, especially when loading for a long trip. There are at least four methods that can be used to do this: PARAFFIN METHOD: Using a double boiler, paraffin is melted and brushed on the clean, unrusted cans. Be certain to get a good coat on all seams, particularly the joints. If the can is small enough, it can be dipped directly into the wax. Care must be taken to not cause the labels to separate from the cans. Do not leave in long enough for the can to get warm. PASTE WAX METHOD: Combine 2-3 oz. of paste or jelly wax with a quart of mineral spirits. Warm the mixture CAREFULLY in its container by immersing it in a larger container of hot water. DO NOT HEAT OVER AN OPEN FLAME! Stir the wax/spirits thoroughly until it is well mixed and dissolved. Paint the cans with a brush in the same manner as above. Place the cans on a wire rack until dry. SPRAY SILICONE: A light coating of ordinary spray silicone may be used to deter rust. Spray lightly, allow to dry, wipe gently with a clean cloth to remove excess silicone. CLEAR COATING: A clear type of spray or brush on coating such as Rustoleum may be applied. This is best suited for larger resealable cans, but will keep them protected from corrosion for years. D. SUGAR, HONEY AND OTHER SWEETENERS There are a wide number of sugars to be found for purposes of sweetening foods. Fructose is the primary sugar in fruit and honey; maltose is one of the sugars in malted grains; pimentose are found in olives and sucrose is what we know as granulated or table sugar. Sucrose is a highly refined product made primarily from sugar cane though sugar beets still contribute a fair amount of the world supply. Modern table sugar is now so highly refined as to be virtually 100% pure and nearly indestructible if protected from moisture. Powdered sugar and brown sugar are simple variations on granulated sugar and share its long life. Liquid sweeteners do not have quite the longevity of dry sugars. Honey, cane syrup, molasses, corn syrup and maple syrup may crystallize or mold during long storage. These syrups are chemically not as simple as table sugar and therefore lose flavor and otherwise break down over time. D.1 TYPES OF GRANULATED SUGARS Buying granulated sugar and its close cousins is really a very simple matter. Buy a brand you know you can trust and be certain the package is clean, dry and has no insect infestation. There\\'s very little that can go wrong with it. GRANULATED: Granulated sugar does not spoil, but if it gets damp it will likely cake up or get lumpy. If it does, it can simply be pulverized again until it regains its granulated texture. Granulated sugar can be found in varying textures, coarser or finer. \"Castor/caster sugar\" is a finer granulation than what is commonly sold as table sugar in the U.S. and is more closely equivalent to our super fine or berry sugar. POWDERED, All names refer to the same kind of sugar, that is CONFECTIONERS, white granulated sugar very finely ground. For ICING: commercial use there is a range of textures from coarse to ultra-fine. For home consumption, what is generally found is either Very Fine (6X) or Ultra-Fine (10X), but this can vary from nation to nation. Not all manufacturers will indicate the grind on the package though. Sugar refiners usually add a small amount of corn-starch to prevent caking. Powdered sugar is as inert as granulated sugar, but it is even more hygroscopic and will absorb any moisture present. If it absorbs more than a little it may cake up and get hard. It\\'s difficult to reclaim hardened powdered sugar, but it can still be used like granulated sugar. BROWN, In the United States brown sugar is basically just refined LIGHT & DARK: white sugar that has had a bit of molasses or sugar syrup and caramel coloring added to it. Dark brown sugar has more molasses which gives it a stronger flavor, a darker color and makes it damp. Light brown sugar has less molasses which gives it a milder flavor, a blonder color and is slightly dryer than the dark variety. For storage purposes you may want to just stock the dark variety. Light brown sugar can be made by combining one fourth to one third white sugar to the remainder dark brown sugar and blend thoroughly. Both varieties need to be protected from drying out, or they will become very hard and difficult to deal with. Nor do you want to allow them to become damper than what they already are. There are granulated and liquid brown sugars available, but they don\\'t have the same cooking qualities as ordinary brown sugars. They also don\\'t dry out and harden quite so readily either. RAW, NATURAL, In recent years, sugar refiners have realized that & TURBINADO: there is a market for less refined forms of cane sugar in the U.S. and have begun to sell this kind of sugar under various names and packagings. None of it is really raw sugar since it is illegal to sell it in the U.S. due to the high impurities level in the truly raw product. All of it has been processed in some form or fashion to clean it, but it has not been subjected to the full refining and whitening processes of ordinary white table sugar. This leaves some of the natural color and a mild flavor in the sweetener. All of these less refined sugars may be stored and handled like brown sugar. Outside of the United States it is possible to buy truly raw sugar and it can be found under names such as \"muscavado\", \"jaggery\" (usually a raw palm or date sugar), \"demerara\" and others. With all of the molasses and other impurities retained it is quite strong in flavor so would not be suited to general use, but there are recipes that call for it. In spite of moisture and impurities it can be stored like brown sugar since its sugar content is high enough to inhibit most microbial growth. D.1.1 STORING GRANULATED SUGARS All granulated sugars have basically the same storage requirements. They need to be kept in air tight, insect and moisture proof containers. For powdered, and granulated sugar you might want to consider using some desiccant in the storage container if your local climate is damp. Since brown sugars and raw sugars are supposed to be moist, they do not need desiccants. Shelf life is indefinite if kept dry, but anything that you intend to eat really should be rotated over time. Time has a way of affecting even the most durable of foods. I\\'ve used brown sugar that was six years old at the time it was removed from storage and, other than the molasses settling somewhat toward the bottom, it was just fine. A friend to whom I gave a bucket of the brown sugar finished it off three years after I gave it to her which was nine years after it was packaged and it, too, was fine. D.2 TYPES OF HONEY Honey is probably the oldest sweetener known to man. Its use predates recorded history and has been found in the Egyptian pyramids. It\\'s typically sweeter than granulated sugar by a factor of 25%-40% depending upon the specific flowers from which the bees gather their nectar. This means a smaller amount of honey can give the same amount of sweetening as sugar. The source flowers also dictate the flavor and the color of the sweetener as well. Honey color can range from very dark (nearly black) to almost colorless. As a general rule, the lighter the color and the more delicate the flavor, the greater the price the honey will bring. As you might expect, since honey is sweeter than table sugar, it also has more calories as well -- 22 per teaspoon compared to granulated sugar\\'s 16 per teaspoon. There are also trivial amounts of minerals and vitamins in the bee product while white sugar has none. Raw honey may also contain minute quantities of botulinum spores and should not be fed to children under one year of age. PLEASE READ THE POST FROM GERI GUIDETTI CONCERNING THIS BELOW. Raw honey is OK for older children and adults. Honey is not a direct substitute for table sugar however, its use in recipes may call for a bit of alteration to get it to turn out right. Honey comes in a number of forms in the retail market and they all have different storage characteristics: WHOLE-COMB: This is the bee product straight from the hive. It is the most unprocessed form in which honey comes, being found as large pieces of waxy comb floating in raw honey. The comb itself will contain many unopened honey cells. RAW: This is unheated honey that has been removed from the comb. It may contain bits of wax, insect parts and other small detritus. FILTERED: This is raw honey that has been warmed to make it more easy to filter out small particles and impurities. Other than being somewhat cleaner than raw honey it is essentially the same. Most of the trace amounts of nutrients remain intact. LIQUID: This is honey that has been heated to higher temperatures to allow for easier filtering and to kill any microorganisms. Usually lighter in color, this form is milder in flavor, resists crystallization and generally clearer. It stores the best of the various forms of honey. Much of the trace amounts of vitamins, however, are lost. SPUN or This honey has had some of its moisture content removed to CRYSTALLIZED: make a creamy spread. It is the most processed form of honey. D.2.1 BUYING HONEY Much of the honey sold in supermarkets has been blended from a variety of different honeys and some may have even had other sweeteners added as well. Like anything involving humans, buying honey can be a tricky business. It pays to deal with individuals and brands you know you can trust. In the United States you should buy products labeled U.S. GRADE A or U.S. FANCY if buying in retail outlets. However, be aware there are no federal labeling laws governing the sale of honey, so only honey labeled pure is entirely honey and not blended with other sweeteners. Honey grading is a matter of voluntary compliance which means some producers may be lax and sloppy about it. This can be a real nuisance when producers use words like \"organic\", \"raw\", \"uncooked\" and \"unfiltered\" on their labels, possibly to mislead. Fortunately, most honey producers are quite honest in their product labeling so if you\\'re not certain of who to deal with, it is worthwhile to ask around to find out who produces a good product. Honey may also contain trace amounts of drugs used in treating various bee ailments, including antibiotics. If this is a concern to you, then it would be wise to investigate with your local honey producer what has been used. D.2.2 STORING HONEY Honey is much easier to store than to select and buy. Pure honey won\\'t mold, but may crystallize over time. Exposure to air and moisture can cause color to darken and flavor to intensify and may speed crystallization as well. Comb honey doesn\\'t store as well liquid honey so you should not expect it to last as long. Storage temperature is not as important for honey, but it should be kept from freezing and not exposed to high temperatures if possible. Either extreme can cause crystallization and heat may cause flavor to strengthen undesirably. Filtered liquid honey will last the longest in storage. Storage containers should be opaque, airtight, moisture and odor-proof. Like any other stored food, honey should be rotated through the storage cycle and replaced with fresh product. If crystallization does occur, honey can be reliquified by placing the container in a larger container of hot water until it has melted. Avoid storing honey near heat sources and if using plastic pails don\\'t keep it near petroleum products (including gasoline/diesel engines), chemicals or any other odor-producing products.

Yes, raw honey can contain the temperature resistant spores of \"Clostridium botulinum\", the bacterium that causes botulism. The organism is a strict anaerobe, meaning that it only grows in the absence of molecular oxygen. The problem with infants and honey is that the small, intestinal tract of an infant apparently is sufficiently anaerobic to allow the spores to germinate into actively growing C. botulinum organisms. Essentially, the infant serves the same role as a sealed, airtight, contaminated can of beans as far as the organisms are concerned. There in the infant\\'s body the bacteria secrete the dangerous toxin that causes the symptoms of botulism. There have been quite a few documented infant deaths due to honey. As I recall, the studies identifying honey as the source were done in the \\'80s. Most pediatricians recommend no honey for the first year. It is probably best to check with your own for even later updates...Geri Guidetti, The Ark Institute D.2.4 HONEY OUTGASSING Q: My can of honey is bulging. Is it safe to use? A: Honey can react with the can lining to release a gas especially when stored over a long period of time. Honey\\'s high sugar content prevents bacteria growth. If there is no sign of mold growth, it is safe to eat. FREQUENTLY ASKED FOOD QUESTIONS, FN250 D.3 TYPES OF CANE SYRUPS. MOLASSES & These two sweeteners are not precisely the same thing. CANE SYRUP: Molasses is a by-product of sugar refining and cane syrup is simply cane juice boiled down to a syrup, in much the same way as maple syrup is produced. Non-Southerners (U.S.) may know it better as unsulphured molasses even if this is not completely correct. Sulphured molasses is also available on the market and very cheap as well, but it\\'s strong flavor is unattractive and generally not desirable. SORGHUM: This is produced in the same manner as cane syrup, but sorghum cane, rather than sugar cane, is used. Sorghum tends to have a thinner, slightly sourer taste than cane syrup. TREACLE: This sweetener comes in varying colors from a rather dark version, similar to, but not quite the same as blackstrap molasses, to paler versions more similar to golden syrup. All of the above syrups are generally dark with a rich, heavy flavor. GOLDEN SYRUP: This syrup seems to be both lighter and paler in color than any of the above three, probably more similar to what we would call a table syrup here in the U.S. TABLE SYRUP: There are many table syrups sold in supermarkets, some with flavorings of one sort or another such as maple, various fruits, etc. A close examination of the ingredients list will reveal mixtures of cane syrup, cane sugar syrup or corn syrup along with preservatives, colorings and other additives. They usually have a much less pronounced flavor than molasses, cane syrup, sorghum or the darker treacles. Any syrup containing corn syrup should be stored as corn syrup. D.3.1 STORING CANE SYRUPS All of the above syrups, except for those having corn syrup in their makeup, have the same storage characteristics. They can be stored on the shelf for about two years and up to a year after opening. Once they are opened, they are best kept in the refrigerator to retard mold growth. If mold growth does occur, the syrup should be discarded. The outside of the bottle should be cleaned of drips after each use. Some pure cane and sorghum syrups may crystallize in storage, but this causes no harm and they can be reliquified using the same method as for honey. D.4 CORN SYRUP Corn syrup is a liquid sweetener made by an enzyme reaction with corn-starch. Available in both a light and a dark form, the darker variety has a flavor similar to molasses and contains refiners syrup (a byproduct of sugar refining). Both types often contain flavorings and preservatives. It is commonly used in baking and candy making because it does not crystallize when heated. Corn syrup is very common in the U.S., but less so in the rest of the world. Corn syrup stores poorly compared to other sweeteners and because of this it often has a best if used by dating code on the bottle. It should be stored in its original bottle, tightly capped, in a cool, dry place. New unopened bottles keep about six months from the date on the label. After opening, keep the corn syrup four to six months. These syrups are very prone to mold and to fermentation so be on the lookout for bubbling or a mold haze. If these present themselves, throw the syrup out. You should always be certain to wipe off any drips from the bottle after every use. D.5 MAPLE SYRUP Maple syrup is produced by boiling down sap of the maple tree until it reaches a syrup consistency and is slightly sweeter than table sugar. Maple syrup is judged by much the same criteria as honey: Lightness of color, clarity and taste. Pure maple is generally expensive and most pancake syrups are corn and cane sugar syrups with either natural or artificial flavorings. Maple flavored pancake syrups should be kept and stored as corn syrups. New unopened bottles of maple syrup may be kept on a cool, dark, shelf for up to two years. The sweetener may darken and the flavor get stronger, but it is still usable. After the bottle has been opened, it should be refrigerated. It will last about a year. Be careful to look out for mold growth. If mold occurs, discard the syrup. E. FATS AND OILS All oils are fats, but not all fats are oils. They are very similar to each other in their chemical makeup, but what makes one an oil and another a fat is the percentage of hydrogen saturation in the fatty acids of which they are composed. The fats and oils which are available to us for culinary purposes are actually mixtures of differing fatty acids so for practical purposes we\\'ll say saturated fats are solid at room temperature (70 deg. F) and unsaturated fats we call oils are liquid at room temperature. For dietary and nutrition purposes fats are generally classified as saturated, monosaturated and polyunsaturated, which is a further refinement of the amount of saturation of the particular compositions of fatty acids in the fats. E.1 BUYING AND STORING OILS AND FATS There is a problem with storing oils and fats for the long term and that is the fact that they go rancid rather quickly. Rancid fats have been implicated in increased rates of heart disease, atherosclerosis and are carcinogenic (cancer causing) so we want to avoid them if possible. Oxygen is eight times more soluble in fat than in water and it is the oxidation resulting from this exposure that is the primary cause of rancidity. The more polyunsaturated a fat is, the faster it will go rancid. This may not, at first, be readily apparent because vegetable oils have to become several times more rancid than animal fats before our noses can detect it. An extreme example of rancidity is the linseed oil (flaxseed) that we use as a wood finish and a base for oil paints. In just a matter of hours the oil oxidizes into a solid polymer. This is very desirable for wood and paint, very undesirable for food. Because of this difficulty in storing fats and oils for any long period of time many books and articles on the subject of food storage make only passing mention of them, if they say anything at all. This is unfortunate because fat contains nine calories to the gram compared to the four calories contained by either carbohydrates or protein. This makes fat a valuable source of concentrated calories that could be of real importance if faced with a diet consisting largely of unrefined grains and legumes. For small children, infants and the elderly, they may not be able to consume the volume of food that would be necessary in the course of a day to get all of the calories they would need to avoid weight loss and possible malnutrition. Additionally, fats play an important role in our perception of taste and texture and their absence would make many foods more difficult to prepare and consume. Furthermore, a small amount of dietary fat is necessary for our bodies to properly absorb fat soluble vitamins like A,D,E and K. Long term storage of fats may be problematical, but it is not impossible. There are some general rules you can follow to get the most life out of your stored cooking oils and fats. 1 Exposure to oxygen, light and heat are the greatest factors to rancidity. If you can, refrigerate your stored oil, particularly after it\\'s been opened. If possible, buy your oils in opaque, airtight containers. If you purchase it in plastic, particularly clear plastic, then transfer it to a gas impermeable glass or metal container that can be sealed airtight. If you have a means of doing so, vacuum sealing the storage container is an excellent idea as it removes most of the air remaining inside, taking much of the oxygen with it. Transparent glass and plastic containers should be stored in the dark, such as in a box. Regardless of the storage container, it should be stored at as cool a temperature as possible and rotated as fast as is practical. Oils and fats with preservatives added by the manufacturer will have a greater shelf life than those without them, provided they are fresh when purchased. 2 Unless they have been specially treated, unopened cooking oils have a shelf life of about a year, depending upon the above conditions. Some specialty oils such as sesame and flax seed have shorter usable lives. If you don\\'t use a great deal of it, try to not buy your fats in large containers. This way you won\\'t be exposing a large quantity to the air after the you\\'ve opened it, to grow old and possibly rancid, before you can use it all up. Once opened, it is an excellent idea to refrigerate cooking fats. If it turns cloudy or solid, the fat is still perfectly usable and will return to its normal liquid, clear state after it has warmed to room temperature. Left at room temperatures, opened bottles of cooking oils can begin to rancid in anywhere from a week to a couple of months, though it may take several more months to reach such a point of rancidity that it can be smelled. 3 Although darker colored oils have more flavor than paler colored, the agents that contribute to that flavor and color also contribute to faster rancidity. For maximum shelf life buy paler colored oils. 4 If you have no particular problem with using it, the culinary fat with the most shelf life as it comes from the store is hydrogenated shortening in its unopened metal or metal lined can. The brand most familiar in the U.S. is probably Crisco, but there are many others. Solid shortening is usually composed of partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, but there are some that also contain animal fats. Some brands will also contain anti-oxidant preservatives as well. All other conditions being equal, those with preservatives will have a longer shelf life than those without. It is not possible to give an exact answer, but it is reasonable to expect an unopened metal can of shortening to have a shelf life of eight to ten years if kept reasonably cool, particularly if it has preservatives in it. E.2 EXTENDING SHELF LIFE BY ADDING ANTI-OXIDANTS If obtaining the maximum shelf life in your cooking oils is important to you, it is possible to add anti-oxidant preservatives to the fat after you have purchased it. Used in conjunction with a gas impermeable container, either opaque in color or stored in a dark place, and cool storage temperatures (70 F or less) then shelf life can be extended to about five years, possibly longer. The anti-oxidant in question is Butylated HydroxyToluene (BHT). It is used in the food industry to slow the development of off-flavors, odors and color changes caused by oxidation, mostly in foods that are high in fats and oils. BHT is on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\\'s Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) list as a common preservative. The FDA limits the use of BHT to 0.02% or 200 parts per million (ppm) of the oil or fat content of a food product. The directions that I will be giving below will be for the FDA limit, but there are those who choose to use up to ten times that amount as part of their life extension programs. The level you choose is up to you. BHT is available over the counter in the retail trade, but you have to know where to look for it. The only retail distributor of the anti-oxidant that I am thus far aware of is Twin Laboratories (TwinLab), Ronkonkoma, NY 11779. Their BHT comes in the form of 250 mg gelatin capsules. I\\'ve been able to find their product in several local health food stores. It is also available through mail order sources, but I don\\'t have any names or addresses for that avenue yet. To get the best results you will need the freshest oil you can find. Purchasing it from a large, busy supermarket will probably suffice. You\\'ll also need containers that are gas impermeable such as glass jars, or metal cans. There may be plastic containers with high gas barrier properties that will also serve, but I cannot knowledgeably say about this. It is important that your containers are food grade and are clean, dry and dust-free. Each 250 milligram capsule is sufficient to treat 47 fluid ounces of cooking oil (as per the GRAS guidelines mentioned above). If you have an accurate means of weighing this works out to be 5.3 mg of BHT crystals to every 1 fl oz of oil. If you\\'re using a scale calibrated in grains, such as a reloading powder scale, you may use the following table. BHT BHT in grains OIL in milligrams --------------------------------------------------------- 0.1 grain 1 fl oz 5.3 mg 0.7 grain 8 fl oz (1 cup) 42.4 mg 1.3 grain 16 fl oz (1 pint) 84.8 mg 2.6 grain 32 fl oz (1 quart) 169.6 mg 5.2 grain 64 fl oz (1/2 gal) 339.2 mg 10.3 grain 128 fl oz (1 gal) 678.4 mg NOTE: The grain weight measurements have been rounded up to the nearest tenth grain since most powder scales will not accurately measure less than one-tenth of a grain. IMPORTANT NOTE: If you are using a reloading powder scale, be sure the balance pan is clean and the balance has been calibrated recently with a reliable set of check weights. Remove the BHT crystals from their gelatin capsules and weigh, if you\\'re going to. Once you have the appropriate amount, add the crystals to a pint or so of the oil, shaking vigorously. It may take several hours for the preservative to dissolve completely. Bringing the oil up to a warm, NOT HOT, temperature will speed the process. Once completely dissolved, pour the anti-oxidant laden oil into the rest of the oil and mix thoroughly. Once mixed, the oil can then be poured into its storage containers leaving approximately 1/2 inch of headspace. If you have a vacuum sealer the jars or cans may be vacuum sealed to remove most of the oxygen from the container, otherwise just seal the lid. Store in a cool place and if using transparent jars, be certain to put them in a larger container such as a box to keep the contents in the dark. Don\\'t forget to label and date the jars. There are other preservatives in food industry use that will also work, but I have not yet discovered how they are used or where to get them. I\\'m currently looking for information on Butylated HydroxyAnisole (BHA), propyl gallate, vitamin E (the tocopherols, natural and synthetic), ascorbyl palmitate (a fat soluble form of vitamin C), citric acid and mono-Tertiary-ButylHydroQuinone (TBHQ). Additionally, certain herbs and spices like cloves, rosemary, oregano, sage and vanilla also have antioxidant properties, sometimes quite strong ones. Being strongly flavored, they are not suitable as preservatives in fats meant for general use, but will lend their protective properties in any recipes that call for them. Before I close out this section on fats and oils, please allow me to reemphasize that no amount of preservatives that can be added to your stored fats will substitute for proper storage and rotation. The more I research the chemistry and physiological effects of rancid fats the more I come to believe they are bad news for long term health, particularly as we grow older. Don\\'t sit on your oil supply for years without rotating it. Just a little bit rancid is just a little bit poisonous. `Nuff said. F. COOKING STAPLES F.1 BAKING POWDER. This powder is a combination of an acid and an alkali with starch added to keep the other two ingredients stable and dry. The powder reacts with liquid by foaming and the resulting bubbles can aerate and raise dough. Almost all baking powder now on the market is double acting, meaning it has one acid that bubbles at room temperature and another acid which only reacts at oven temperatures. Unless a recipe specifies otherwise, this is the type to use. Don\\'t expose baking powder to steam, humid air, wet spoons, or any other moisture. Store in a tightly lidded container for no more than a year. Even when kept bone dry it will eventually loses its potency. To test its strength, measure 1 tsp powder into 1/3 cup hot water. The mixture should fizz and bubble furiously. If it doesn\\'t, throw it out. For those folks concerned with aluminum in the diet, the Rumford brand has none in it and there may be others. F.2 BAKING SODA. This gritty powder is sodium bicarbonate also called sodium acid bicarbonate (NaHCO3), a mild alkali. It is used in baking to leaven bread and other baked or fried foods and does so in the same manner as baking powder. It can also be used to make hominy. When combined with an acid ingredient, the bicarbonate reacts to give off carbon dioxide bubbles which causes the baked good to rise. If kept well sealed in an air- and moisture-proof container its storage life is indefinite. If kept in the cardboard box it usually comes in, it will keep for about eighteen months. Do keep in mind that baking soda is a wonderful odor adsorber. If you don\\'t want your baked goods tasting of whatever smells it adsorbed then keeping it in an airtight container is an excellent idea. F.3 HERBS AND SPICES. It is difficult to give exact instructions on how best to store culinary herbs and spices because there are dozens of different seeds, leaves, roots, barks, etc., we call an herb or a spice. There are, however, some general rules to be followed to best preserve their flavors. All spices, particularly dried, are especially sensitive to heat, air and light. Room temperature is satisfactory for keeping them and refrigeration or freezing is even better, but they should be kept away from heat sources. It is common for the household spice cabinet or shelf to be located over the stove, but this is really a very poor place. Dark opaque glass is best for storage, but failing that, keeping a tightly sealed glass container in a dark place is next best. The cellophane packets some products come in just won\\'t do. Tightly sealed metal containers will work as well. Even dense plastic will do, but glass is best. Where possible, buy spices whole. Whole nutmegs will keep their flavor far longer than ground nutmeg, the same for other seeds and roots. You\\'ll have to use a grater, grinder or whatever, but the difference in flavor will be worth it. If you buy spices in bulk containers (which is certainly cheaper) consider transferring some into smaller containers and keeping the larger one tightly sealed in a cool, dark place. This will prevent unwanted light and air from continually getting in and playing havoc. Included in the suppliers addresses are listings for several spice and herb companies. The one I have personally dealt with so far is Penzey\\'s and their products have been consistently excellent with good prices. It\\'s worth investigating some of these companies as they can really take the sting out of purchasing large quantities. F.4 SALT. Storage life for salt is indefinite. So long as you do not let it get contaminated with dirt or whatever, it will never go bad. Over time, iodized salt may turn yellow, but this is harmless and may still be used. Salt is rather hygroscopic and will adsorb moisture from the air if not sealed in an air-tight container. If it does adsorb moisture and cakes up, it can be dried in the oven and then broken up with no harm done. All salt, however, is not the same. Salt comes in a number of different varieties, and very little of what is produced in the U.S. is intended for use in food. The rest of it, about 98%, has other uses. Therefore, it is important to be certain the salt you have is intended for human consumption. Once you are satisfied it is, you should then determine its appropriateness for the tasks to which you might want to set it to. Below is a partial list of some of the available salts TABLE SALT: This is by far the most widely known type of salt. It comes in two varieties; iodized and non-iodized. There is an ingredient added to it to adsorb moisture so it will stay free flowing in damp weather. This non-caking agent does not dissolve in water and can cause cloudiness in whatever solution it is used if sufficiently large quantities are used. In canning it won\\'t cause a problem since there is very little per jar. For pickling, though, it would be noticeable. If you are storing salt for this purpose, you should be sure to choose plain pickling salt, or other food grade pure salt such as kosher salt. In the iodized varieties, the iodine can cause discoloration or darkening of pickled foods so be certain not to use it for that purpose. For folks who come from areas that are historically iodine deficient a store of iodized salt for table consumption is of real importance. CANNING SALT: This is pure salt and nothing but salt. It can usually be found in the canning supplies section of most stores. This is the salt to be preferred for most food preservation or storage uses. It is generally about the same grain size as table salt. KOSHER SALT: This salt is not really, in itself, kosher, but is used in \"kashering\" meat to make the flesh kosher for eating. This involves first soaking the meat then rubbing it with the salt to draw out the blood which is not-kosher and is subsequently washed off along with the salt. The cleansed meat is then kosher. What makes it of interest for food storage and preservation is that it is generally pure salt suitable for canning, pickling and meat curing. It is of a larger grain size than table or canning salt, and usually rolled to make the grains flaked for easier dissolving. Frequently it is slightly cheaper than canning salt and usually easier to find in urban/suburban areas. NOTE: Not all brands of kosher salt are exactly alike. Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt is the only brand that I\\'m aware of that is not flaked, but still in its unaltered crystal form. The Morton brand of Coarse Kosher Salt has \"yellow prussiate of soda\" added as an anti-caking agent. Morton still recommends it for pickling and even gives a kosher dill recipe on the box so I presume that this particular anti-caking agent does not cause cloudiness in pickling solutions. Whether flaked or in its unaltered crystal form, kosher salt takes up more volume for an equivalent amount of mass than does canning salt. If it is important to get a very precise amount of salt in your pickling or curing recipe you may want to weigh the salt to get the correct amount. SEA SALT: This type of salt comes in about as many different varieties as coffee and from about as many different places around the world. The \"gourmet\" versions can be rather expensive. In general, the types sold in grocery stores, natural food markets and gourmet shops have been purified enough to use in food. It\\'s not suitable for food preservation, though, because the mineral content it contains (other than the sodium chloride) may cause discoloration of the food. ROCK or ICE This type of salt comes in large chunky crystals and CREAM SALT: is intended primarily for use in home ice cream churns to lower the temperature of the ice filled water in which the churn sits. It\\'s also sometimes used in icing down beer kegs or watermelons. It is used in food preservation by some, but none of the brands I have been able to find label it as food grade nor do they specifically mention its use in foods so I would not use it for this purpose. SOLAR SALT: This is also sometimes confusingly called \"sea salt\". It is not, however, the same thing as the sea salt found in food stores. Most importantly, it is not food grade. It\\'s main purpose is for use in water softeners. The reason it is called \"solar\" and sometimes \"sea salt\" is that it is produced by evaporation of sea water in large ponds in various arid areas of the world. This salt type is not purified and still contains the desiccated remains of whatever aquatic life might have been trapped in it. Those organic remains might react with the proteins in the foods you are attempting to preserve and cause it to spoil. HALITE: For those of us fortunate enough to live in areas warm enough not need it, halite is the salt that is used on roads to melt snow and ice. It, too, is not food grade and should not be used in food preservation. This form of salt is also frequently called rock salt, like the rock salt above, but neither are suitable for food use. SALT These are various other kinds of metal salts such as SUBSTITUTES: potassium chloride used to substitute for the ordinary sodium chloride (NaCl) salt we are familiar with. They have their uses, but should not be used in foods undergoing a heated preservation processing, as they can cause the product to taste bad. Even the heat from normal cooking is sometimes sufficient to cause this. F.5 VINEGAR. There is vinegar and then there is vinegar and it is not all alike. The active ingredient in all vinegars is acetic acid, but how the sour stuff was made can vary widely. The most common vinegar is white distilled which is actually just diluted distilled acetic acid and not true vinegar at all. It keeps pretty much indefinitely if tightly sealed in a plastic or glass bottle with a plastic cap. The enamel coated metal caps always seem to get eaten by the acid over time. It is usually about 5-6% acetic acid and for pickling it is the type most often called for. The next most common variety is apple cider vinegar. There are two kinds of this type. A cider flavored distilled acetic acid type and a true cider vinegar fermented from hard cider. Either will store indefinitely at room temperature until a sediment begins to appear on the bottom. Stored vinegar will sometimes develop a cloudy substance. This is called a mother of vinegar and it is harmless. As long as the liquid does not begin to smell foul it can be filtered out through cheesecloth or a coffee filter and rebottled in a clean container. The mother can even be used to make more vinegar. If it begins to smell bad, however, it\\'s gone over and should be tossed out. The more exotic wine, balsalmic and other vinegars can be stored like cider vinegar. Age and exposure to light and air, however, eventually begin to take their toll on their delicate flavors. Tightly capped in a cool, dark cabinet or refrigerator is best for their storage. F.6 YEAST. Yeast is just not a product you can stow away and forget about until you need it next year. It is, after all, a living organism and if it\\'s not alive at the time you need it, you won\\'t get any use out of it. This ancient leavening, brewing, fermenting agent is a single celled microscopic fungus. When we incorporate it into our bread dough, beer wort or fruit juice it begins to reproduce madly (we hope) and produce several by-products. If you\\'re baking, the by-product you want is carbon dioxide which is trapped by the dough and subsequently causes it to rise. In brewing or vintning what is wanted is the ethyl alcohol and, if the drink is to be carbonated, the carbon dioxide as well. Almost all yeasts used for these purposes are in the same genus (\"Saccharomyces\" or sugar fungi), but several different species have evolved and some are more suitable for a particular task than others. It\\'s entirely possible to use grocery store bread yeast to brew beer or ferment wine, but the results may leave a great deal to be desired. It\\'s also possible to use yeast from beer brewing to make bread and from what I\\'ve read the results were pretty much indistinguishable from bread yeast. Leaving aside the brewing and vintning yeasts which are really outside the scope of this FAQ I am going to concentrate on bread yeast. It comes in two generally available forms; compressed or fresh and dried, sometimes called granular or instant active dry yeast. They are different genetic strains of the same species, and have different characteristics. Compressed yeast is only partly dried (about 70% moisture) and requires refrigeration and keeps even better in the deep freeze. If kept in an air- and moisture-tight container to prevent it from desiccating this type of yeast will keep for a year in the freezer (0 deg. F or less), but only about two weeks (maybe a bit more) in the refrigerator. Unless your kitchen is rather chilly it will not keep on the shelf. It should not have a mottled color or a sour odor. Dried yeast has only an 8% moisture content and comes packed in foil envelopes. The smaller single use packets are not generally vacuum packed, but the larger commercial sized \"bricks\" of about a pound or two each generally are. They can last for months on the shelf, until the expiration date which should be clearly stamped on the package. If packaged in the same manner as recommended for compressed yeast above and kept in the refrigerator or freezer it can last for several years. The larger packs of yeast should be transferred to an air and moisture tight container after opening. Either type of yeast can be tested for viability by proofing it. This is nothing more than mixing a small amount of the yeast with an equal amount of sugar in warm water (105-115 deg. F for dried; 95 deg. F for fresh). Within about five minutes active yeast will become bubbly and begin to expand (at normal room temperature). Yeast which only slowly becomes active can still be used, but you will have to use more of it. If it shows no activity at all, it\\'s dead and should be thrown out. There is another means of providing yeast for baking besides buying it from the grocery store and that is by using a sourdough starter. I\\'m not going to address it here, but I will point out that it has a newsgroup all its own (rec.food.sourdough) and several FAQ\\'s devoted to it. You can find addresses for these FAQs in the Resources section. Drop in and read for awhile and you\\'ll learn more than you thought you could ever want to know. G. INFANT FORMULA Since most folks interested in food storage are planning for families, real or as yet hypothetical, I thought it important to include something on infant formula. Most baby food that comes in jars can be treated like canned goods of similar types meant for adults. Formula, though, is something else. I have to admit, that not yet having kids of my own, I\\'ve not given this much thought before so the below is taken from the book KEEPING FOOD FRESH, by Janet Bailey (see book list). In the future, if some of you readers will send it to me and/or I come up with more information from my own researches I want to expand this section on infant/child food storage. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Prepared infant formula is primarily water and nonfat cow\\'s milk. Among other ingredients, it contains sweeteners; sometimes lactose which is milk sugar; and sometimes corn syrup or other sugars. Coconut and soybean oils are common; vitamin and mineral supplements are universal. A few brands contain mono- and diglycerides, chemicals that keep the liquid from separating. BUYING AND STORING INFANT FORMULA. Canned liquid infant formula comes either ready to eat or in a concentrate to be diluted with water. Cans and packing cases are clearly marked with a \"use by\" date. Unopened cans stored in a cool, dry place keep well from twelve to eighteen months (longer than the baby is an infant). After the can is opened, measure out the amount of formula you need, cover the can and store in the refrigerator. It will keep no more than 48 hrs at 40 deg. F. Never return leftover formula from the bottle to the storage container and do not store half used bottles. You can pre-measure the whole can-full into sterilized baby bottles, seal them, and store them in the refrigerator, but forty eight hours is still the limit. To keep full bottles from tipping over in the refrigerator, slip them into a carton from a six-pack of soda pop bottles. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ In examining the offerings at my local grocer I see that infant formula is also offered as a dry powder to be mixed by the parent. I could not come to a ready idea of how long the formula powder might be good on the shelf since it seemed to vary radically depending on exact type and manufacturer. The shortest use-by date was only a year, but some had use-by dates three years into the future. Clearly, this is an area that is going to need much investigation. I hope some of our knowledgeable readers out there will be able to help out. ======================================================================= -- III -- SPOILAGE ======================================================================= A -- INSECT INFESTATIONS A.1 PESTS OF STORED GRAINS, LEGUMES AND DRY FOODSTUFFS Insect infestations can occur in a wide variety of foodstuffs such as flours, meals, pastas, dried fruits and vegetables, nuts, sweets, whole grains, beans, sugars, TVP, jerky, bird seed and pet foods. Naturally, the best way to deal with an insect infestation is not to have one in the first place. Try to purchase from suppliers who are clean and have a high volume of turnover of their products. This will mean the products you purchase will be less likely to have bugs in them. When you buy foodstuffs examine them closely to be sure they are insect free. Check for any packaging or use by dates to insure their freshness. Don\\'t shake the package, most adult insects will be found in the top couple of inches of the product and shaking the package will mix them into the contents and disguise them. If the package does turn out to be infested, return it for replacement. Once you have purchased the product you should store it in an air- and moisture-tight container so it cannot be invaded after you have brought it home. With sufficient time, adult and some larval insect forms can penetrate paper, cardboard and thin plastic packaging. Your containers should be either heavy plastic, glass or metal with tight fitting lids. As with everything in food storage, you should use older packages before newer ones and opened packages before unopened ones. The storage area should be kept clean. Don\\'t allow grain, flour, beans, bits of pasta or other food particles to accumulate on shelves or the floor. Cracks and crevices should be sealed or otherwise blocked. Unless it is a sticky spill, vacuuming is the best method of cleaning since cleaning with soap and water can wash food particles into the cracks. Insects may get their start in chairs, sofas and carpets where food is dropped and not cleaned up. Don\\'t forget to replace the filter bag on the vacuum since some insects can survive and reproduce in the bag after they\\'ve been sucked into it. Bags of dry pet food and bird seed can also harbor insect infestation. Decorative foodstuffs such as ears of colorful Indian corn, colored beans and hard squashes can carry insects that can infest your edible food. Even poison baits can harbor flour beetles. A.2 CONTROL OF INSECT INFESTATIONS Should you find that in spite of buying fresh products and using careful packaging techniques you have an insect infestation, you can try some of the following steps: 1. If the food is too heavily infested to try to save it should be disposed of as soon as possible. Remove it from the kitchen or food storage area immediately so it won\\'t infest other foods. 2. Large bugs can be sifted or winnowed out if the food\\'s not too heavily infested and you want to try to save it. Then treat it by placing into a deep freezer at 0 deg. F for three to seven days depending upon the size of the package. Refrigerator freezers usually do not freeze low enough to effectively kill all of the life stages of insects, but if left there, will slow their development. If freezing is not workable then the product could be spread on baking sheets and heated to 150 deg. F for fifteen to twenty minutes, cooled and repackaged. Heat treated foods should be consumed shortly thereafter. 3. The surface areas where the food containers are stored can be treated with an insecticide. This is not a replacement for clean storage habits and good containers, but it can supplement it. This will not control insect infestations already in your stored foods. Spray the shelf surface with 0.5% chlorpyrifos (Dursban), 1% propoxur (Baygon), 0.5 percent diazinon, or 0.25 percent resmethrin. You can find any of these in the hardware store in ready to apply packages. If a sprayer isn\\'t feasible then they can be applied with a paint brush. Allow the solution to dry thoroughly. Cover the shelves with clean, untreated shelf paper and put properly packaged foods back on shelves. READ THE PRODUCT LABEL FOR SAFETY INFORMATION CONCERNING CHILDREN AND PETS. Household bleach, Lysol and other sterilizers will not control insect infestation, though they can be used for mold, mildew and algae. You may continue to find some insects after the cleanup is finished. This could be for several reasons. The first being they escaped from the packages they were infesting and did not get cleaned up. There may be more packages infested than were originally realized or, there may be hiding places in the storage area that need attention. Once you have carefully eliminated all food sources, the bugs should disappear in three to four weeks. B -- MOLDS IN FOOD Molds are fungi just like mushrooms and yeast. Also like mushrooms, they reproduce by releasing spores into the air that land on everything, including your food and food storage containers. If those spores begin to grow, they create thin threads that spread through out their growing medium. These threads are the roots of the mold fungus, called \"mycelium\". The stalk of a mold fungus is the portion above or on the surface of the food. It produces the spores and gives the mold its color. We\\'ve all seen examples of this when we discover a dish of something or other left way-y-y too long in the refrigerator and has become covered in mold fuzz. Molds can grow anywhere they have a growing medium (their food), sufficient moisture and enough warmth. Some can even grow at refrigerator temperatures, albeit more slowly than they would if it were warmer. They can also withstand much more salt and sugar than bacteria, which is why you sometimes find mold in jellies and jams with their high sugar content and on cured products like ham or bacon with their high salt content. In the past, it was often felt a slight amount of mold was harmless and the food could be consumed anyway. For molds that were intentionally introduced into the food, such as the mold in bleu cheese, this is just fine. For the unintentional molds, it can be a very serious error in judgment. These unwanted molds might just be producing a toxic substance called a \"mycotoxin\" which can be very bad indeed. Mycotoxins are produced around the root or mycelium of the mold and the mold roots can penetrate very deeply into the food. These mycotoxins can survive for a long time in foods, and unfortunately most are not destroyed by cooking. The molds probably best known for this are the various Aspergillus varieties which produces a mycotoxin known as \"aflatoxin\", but there are other dangerous molds as well, such as the Fusarium molds. Both of the above affect grain and some legumes. See B.3 Molds In Grains and Legumes. IMPORTANT NOTE: In wet pack foods such as your home canned goodies, molds can do something else as well, possibly leading to lethal consequences. If they find their way into wet pack acid foods canned by the boiling water bath method, whether by reasons of improper procedure or contamination after the fact, they can consume the natural acids present in the food. The effect of this is to raise the pH of the food in the container, perhaps to the point that it becomes possible for spores of *Clostridium botulinum*, better known as \"botulism\", to become active and reproduce. If you\\'re not already aware of the consequences of botulism poisoning, please read the bacterial spoilage section below where it has an entry all its own. This is the most deadly kind of food poisoning there is. For this reason, moldy wet pack foods should be *safely* discarded. Molds in low acid foods canned by the pressure canning method are equally dangerous and should also be discarded in a safe manner. B.1 MINIMIZING MOLDS You can do a number of things to minimize unwanted mold growth in your kitchen, food storage areas and refrigerators. If your kitchen is at all like mine, it is the refrigerator that is going to collect the most fungal growth. This can be dealt with by washing the inside every couple of months with a tablespoon of baking soda dissolved in a quart of warm water. Rinse clean and allow to dry. The black mildew that grows on the rubber door gaskets and other places can be dealt with by wiping down with a solution of three tablespoons of household bleach in a quart of water. I generally use a soft bristle brush for this. The rest of the kitchen can be kept mold free by keeping it clean, and dry and by spraying occasionally with a product such as Lysol. Patches of mold growing in spots can be eliminated with the bleach solution used on the refrigerator doors. Try not to purchase more fresh food than you\\'ll be able to eat in a short period of time. This will keep you from having to deal with the moldy remains that didn\\'t get eaten. If food does go moldy, don\\'t sniff it. This is a good way to give yourself respiratory difficulties if you are at all susceptible to mold allergies. Moldy food should be disposed in such a manner that your animals and children won\\'t be able to get into it. Mycotoxins are every bit as bad for your animals as they are for you. Obviously, you don\\'t have to throw out everything that shows a spot of mold on it. Some foods can be safely dealt with and still partially saved if they show signs of fungal growth. Below is a set of guideline from M. Susan Brewer, Ph.D., R.D., a specialist in food safety. Her articles and works are found in many state university extension services publications lists. If the food shows even a tiny mold spot, follow these guide lines: 1. Hard or firm foods with tiny mold spots can be trimmed; cut away the area around the mold (at least an inch) and rewrap in clean wrap. Make sure that knife does not touch the mold. 2. Soft foods such as cheese slices, cream cheese, sour cream and yogurt should be thrown away. TOSS: Soft Cheeses, (Mozzarella, Brie, etc.) Sour Cream, Yogurt, Cottage cheese Bacon, Hot dogs, Sliced lunch meats Meat pies Opened canned ham Most left-over food Bread, Cakes, rolls, flour, pastry Peanut butter Juices, berries Jam, Jellies, Syrups Cucumbers, Tomatoes Spinach, Lettuce, other leafy vegetables Bananas, Peaches, Melons Corn-on-the-cob Stored nuts, whole grains, rice TRIM: Hard Cheese (Cheddar, Swiss, etc.) Bell Peppers, Carrots, Cabbage Broccoli, Cauliflower, Brussels Sprouts Garlic, Onions Potatoes, Turnips Zucchini Apples, Pears B.2 MOLDS IN CANNED GOODS If good equipment and proper technique are used, then it is unlikely you will ever have mold growth in your unopened canned goods. If you do have such, then there was either a flaw in the procedure you used, or something affected the jar or can after the fact to break its seal. In any event, once the food has molded, it is past saving and should be discarded in such a way that children and animals will not be able to get into it. The most likely home canned products to show mold growth are jams and jellies sealed with paraffin wax. There are a number of points in the canning process where this can occur: (1) In the time after the jar is taken out of its boiling water bath, but before it is filled. (2) In the time between when the jar is filled and covered with the melted wax. (3) When the wax cools, if it pulls away from the side of the jar, leaving an opening for the mold to get in. (4) If bubbles form in the paraffin, which break and leave holes. It is for this reason that most canning authorities no longer recommend using this technique. If you must use it, the jelly jars should be boiled for at least 10 minutes before the jelly is poured into the jars. The filled and wax capped jars should then be covered with some sort of protective lid. The book, Putting Food By has excellent instructions on this or see the applicable section of the rec.food.preserving FAQ by Leslie Basel. B.3 MOLDS IN GRAINS AND LEGUMES It\\'s long been known that eating moldy grain is bad for your health. The ugly consequences of eating ergot-infected rye probably make the best known example. It\\'s only been for about thirty years, though, that intensive study of these grain fungi have been carried out on other varieties of molds and their respective mycotoxins. Fortunately, for those of us in the U.S., the USDA and the various state departments of agriculture go to a great deal of trouble to detect grain and legumes infected with these toxic fungi. In some of the less developed countries, the citizenry are not so lucky. Still, it is good to have something of an understanding of what one should do to prevent mold growth in one`s stored grains and to have an idea of what to look for and ask about when purchasing grains and legumes. The one fungal type that has caused the most commotion in recent history are the various \"Aspergillus\" species of molds. Under certain conditions with certain grains, legumes, and to a lesser extent, nuts, they can produce a mycotoxin called \"aflatoxin\". This is a serious problem in some parts of the world, most especially in peanuts, occasionally in corn. I am not aware of any documented deaths in the United States from aflatoxicity, but other nations have not been so fortunate. What makes aflatoxin so worrisome in this country is that it is also a very potent carcinogen (cancer causing agent). In addition to the Aspergillus molds, there is also a very large family of molds called \"Fusarium\" and these can produce a wide variety of mycotoxins, all of which you do not want to be eating directly or feeding to your food animals where you will get the toxins back indirectly when you eat them. The Federal government and the various state governments continuously monitor food and forage crops. Those products which are prone to mold growth and toxin production are not allowed to be sold for food. Once purchased however, it is up to you to keep your food safe from mold growth. If you have already found mold growth in your whole grains, meals, flours or other grain products, they should be discarded. Most mycotoxins are not broken down or destroyed by cooking temperatures and there is no safe way to salvage grain that has molded. B.3.1 PREVENTING MOLD GROWTH IN STORED GRAINS AND LEGUMES The easiest method to prevent mold growth in your stored grains and legumes is simply to keep them too dry for the mold to grow. The Aspergillus and Fusarium molds require moisture contents of 18% and above to reproduce. This is subject to some variability, but in all grains and soybeans, they must have a moisture content of that level. If you are storing raw (not roasted) peanuts, in the shell or shelled, you want to get the moisture content to less than 8% as peanuts are particularly susceptible to mold growth. The recommended moisture content for all other grain and legume storage is no more than 10%. *Please see part 2.A.3.1 Grains and Legumes for a method to determine moisture content.* At 10% moisture, it is simply too dry for fungi to grow. *Please see 1.A.4 Storing Grains and Legumes for a suitable packaging technique.* C -- BACTERIAL SPOILAGE Just like the fungi, bacteria are everywhere. They\\'re in the water, soil, air, on you, your food and your food storage containers. Fortunately, the vast majority of the bacteria we encounter are relatively harmless or even benign and only a few represent a danger to us and our stored foods. Bacteria can be very much more difficult to kill off than molds and insects. Some of them are capable of continued growth at temperatures that would kill other spoilage organisms. When conditions are such that they are unable to grow, some bacteria can go dormant and form spores. These spores can be quite hardy, even to the point of surviving a rolling boil. In order to grow, bacteria need moisture, some as little as a 20% moisture content. For dry grains, legumes, powdered milk and other low moisture foodstuff bacterial spoilage will seldom be a problem so long as the moisture level in the foodstuff remains too scant to support its growth. For this reason, it is imperative that such products be drier than 20% and preferably below 10% to ward off mold growth as well. The botulism bacterium needs moisture in the 35% range to grow. Thus, making being sure of the moisture content of the food products you want to store, and appropriately using desiccants in your food packaging are also excellent ideas. WARNING: It is in wet pack canned goods (where the container has free liquid in it) and fresh foods we must be the most concerned about spoilage bacteria. It is here that a little bad luck and a moment\\'s inattention to what you are doing could kill or seriously injure you or some other person who eats the foods you\\'ve put by. In both home-canned and commercially-canned goods, IF THE CAN IS BULGING, LEAKING, SMELLS BAD, OR SPEWS LIQUID WHEN YOU OPEN IT THEN THROW IT OUT! But, throw it out safely so that children and animals cannot get into it. C.1 BOTULISM *Clostridium botulinum* is one of the oldest life forms found on the planet. Like the gangrene bacteria, it is an anaerobic organism meaning it lives and grows in the absence of free oxygen. It forms spores when conditions are not suitable for it to grow and it is commonly found in the soil. This means it can be brought into your life on raw produce, tools, hands or anything else that came into contact with dirt. To further complicate matters, botulinum spores are extremely heat-hardy. The bacteria itself can be killed by exposing them for a short time to boiling water (212 deg. F AT SEA LEVEL PRESSURE), but their spores can not. To kill them, the food product and container must be exposed to temperatures of 240 deg. F (AGAIN AT SEA LEVEL PRESSURE) for a long enough period of time to allow all of the food in each container to come completely up to the proper temperature. Only a pressure- canner can reach the necessary temperature. It\\'s not the bacteria or its spores which are directly deadly, but the toxin the bacteria creates when it grows and reproduces. In its pure form, botulism toxin is so potent that a mere teaspoon of it would be enough to provide a fatal dose to hundreds of thousands of people. It is this lethality that is why every responsible book on canning, food preservation, food storage, and the like hammers constantly on the need for care in technique and method and why spoilage must be taken so seriously. C. botulinum, like any other life form, must have suitable conditions for it to grow and become a danger to you. One of the conditions it must have is a suitable pH range in its environment. pH is the measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a substance and is measured on a scale of 1-14 with anything above 7 being considered alkaline and everything below 7 being considered acid. If the pH of your wet pack food is BELOW 4.6 then botulism is unable to grow. Keep in mind pH is not eternal in foods and it is possible for it to change. If it should change to a lesser acidity than 4.6 pH your previously botulinum proof food may start allowing the lethal spoiler to grow (see B.2, molds in canned goods). This is why it is vital to use proper technique, even for acid foods like tomatoes. It has been found that when this occurs and botulinum becomes active and produces its lethal toxin it also produces minute amounts of acid which can lower the pH of the poisoned food back into what should have been the safe zone had the pH not jumped up and allowed the bacteria to grow. Again and again -- use good technique and pay attention to what you are doing. Botulinum toxin, unlike fungal mycotoxins, can be destroyed by boiling the food briskly in an open vessel for fifteen minutes. Because of this, if your canned food shows any safety problems you should follow this procedure. If the food shows even the slightest mold growth, keep in mind that mycotoxins are not for the most part broken down by heat and dispose of the food safely. I don\\'t intend to go into the hows of home canning here. For that I strongly recommend that you read the *r.f.p. FAQ*, the *Ball Blue Book* and most especially the book *Putting Food By* for in depth information on this subject. C.2 OTHER BACTERIAL SPOILERS OF FOOD This section will be in a future version of this FAQ. D -- ENZYMATIC ACTION IN FOOD SPOILAGE Every living organism uses enzymes of many sorts in its bodily functions as part of its normal life cycle. Enzymes are used in creating life. After death, enzymes play a role in the decomposition of once living tissue. The enzymes in a tomato help it to ripen and enzymes produced by the tomato and whatever fungal and bacterial spoilers are on it cause it to decay. Fortunately, slowing down or stopping the action of a food\\'s enzymes is much easier to do than slowing or stopping some of the bacterial spoilers mentioned above. Enzymes are most active in a temperature range between 85-120 deg. F and begin to be destroyed when the temperature goes above 140 deg.F. Cold also slows down the action of enzymes, which is why fresh tomatoes last longer in the refrigerator than they do on the kitchen table. Most enzymatic action also requires moisture to occur. In foods stored at 10% moisture or less, there is not enough moisture for most enzymes to be active. ======================================================================= -- IV -- SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT QUESTIONS ======================================================================= A -- STORAGE CONTAINERS A.1 WHAT IS FOOD GRADE PACKAGING? Q: OK, I\\'m ready to start my storage program. What should I put the food in? A: You should use food grade packaging for storing anything you intend to eat. A food grade container is one that will not transfer noxious or toxic substances into the food it is holding. If you are uncertain whether a package type is food grade you can contact the manufacturer. Ask if that particular container is (US) FDA approved meaning that it is safe for food use. When inquiring be sure to specify the characteristics of the food you are storing; wet, dry, strongly acidic or alkaline, alcoholic or a high fat content. A container that is approved for one of the above types of food may not be approved for another. The major functions of a food storage container are to: 1. Protect its contents from outside environmental influences such as moisture, and oxygen, but possibly also heat or cold, light, insects and/or rodents as well. 2. Prevent damage during handling and shipping. 3. Establish and/or maintain microbiological stability. The container should not allow microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria from outside the container to come into contact with its contents. This is of critical importance to wet-pack foods such as canned vegetables, fruits and meats. 4. Withstand the temperatures and pressures it will be exposed to. This is necessary if the contents are to be pasteurized or sterilized, either immediately before or after filling. It must not have any structural failures nor release any noxious or toxic breakdown chemicals into the food it contains. This is the reason why purpose built canning jars are recommended for home canning and mayonnaise jars aren\\'t. The former are made heavier to withstand high temperatures and handling whereas the latter are not and have an increased risk of breakage if used for that purpose. Virtually all containers used in home food preservation involving exposure to high temperatures are made of glass or metal, with the exception of some specialized \"heat & seal\" type of plastic bags. Glass can be used with any food type providing it is clean and in sound condition, but metal cans are more specialized. They must be intended for food use and must also have a lining or coating of the inside that is suitable for the pH level of the food it will be in contact with. If the foods are not subjected to some form of heat processing just before or after packaging your selection of container types for home use is a great deal larger. Virtually any kind of clean, sound glass jar can be used and many types of new metal containers. Several sorts of plastics have become popular. These various kinds of plastics are each suited for different purposes, making selection a more complex task. A.1.1 WHERE DO I FIND FOOD GRADE CONTAINERS? Food grade packaging is everywhere. Every time you go into the grocery store you are surrounded by it. Many well known companies such as Tupperware and Rubbermaid manufacture and sell empty packaging for the express purpose of containing repackaged foods. The kinds of containers you are interested in and the types of foods you want to put in those containers will dictate where you need to look for a particular packaging system. For food storage purposes most folks are usually interested in five and six gallon plastic pails, glass jars from pint to gallon sizes, metal containers such as the institutional sized 10 cans, and Mylar or other high barrier property plastic bags. Those are the containers most often used, but virtually anything that can protect foods from outside environmental influences, safely contain something you\\'re going to later eat and have a volume capacity large enough to be worthwhile may be used. A number of food storage retailers such as those listed in the Resources section sell plastic buckets, Mylar bags and a few even sell new 10 cans with lids. It may also be possible to purchase 10 cans through the LDS Family Canneries and dealers such as Lehman\\'s Hardware Cumberland General Store or Home Canning Specialty and Supply. On the local scene, plastic five gallon buckets are widely available, but only if you purchase them through a restaurant or commercial foods supply house will you likely be able to tell if they\\'re safe to keep food in. If you can locate a customer service number for the manufacturer you can call them and ask. Many times manufacturers will make products that are FDA approved and sell them as general purpose containers, but you need to call to be sure. Packaging supply houses, such as United States Plastics and others, have large FDA approved packaging lines. Several such companies are listed in the Resources section and a bit of detective work can probably turn up more. Some require minimum orders and others don\\'t. The cost of shipping the containers will probably play a major role in your decision making. If you are going to package a great deal of food all at once, perhaps for a group of people, some of the companies that require minimum purchases can sometimes save you a fair amount of money and supply packaging you might otherwise have a difficult time finding. Some time spent searching the Thomas Register, available both online (http://www12.thomasregister.com ) and in library reference sections, might turn up some valuable leads. For glass jars, don\\'t overlook flea markets, yard sales, thrift shops and similar places. Canning jars can sometimes be had for very little. Delicatessens, sub shops and restaurants of all sorts can be a source of one gallon glass jars formerly containing pickles, peppers, etc. If the lids are still in good condition, they are well suited to bulk storage and can be reused over and over. Metal cans, by and large, are not reusable for good storage, but some companies might be able to sell you new cans. The traditional single use 10 can is only the beginning of what might be available with a little looking. Gallon sized or larger cans with double friction lids (like paint comes in) make excellent storage containers and some companies make them food safe. One gallon and larger cans with wide diameter screw caps are available from some companies as well. You might have seen some of these holding edible oils, soy sauce, honey and other liquid food. If they come with a cap that will seal air tight they would be well suited for bulk storage of grains and legumes, particularly if they come in a four to six gallon size. Pick up you local phone book, log on to your favorite search engine or head to your local public, college or university library and explore the possibilities. Make it clear that what you want must be FDA approved and be up front about how many you need or can deal with. If one company won\\'t deal with you, try another. You\\'ll eventually get what you want. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ From: Denis DeFigueiredo ddefig@newhall.com Originally posted in: rec.food.preserving I called Berlin [eds. note, a plastic container mfgr.] 1-800- 4-BERLIN and spoke to them, plus an outfit called Kirk Container (they manufactured some 5 gallon paint buckets I saw in the local hardware store). Both places said that buckets made from High Density PolyEthelene (HDPE) are approved for food. It has to do with the possibility of interaction between any chemicals in the food and the plastic. As it turns out, Kirk manufactures only one kind of bucket, and then markets it for paint, hardware, food, etc. The price is right on the \"paint buckets\" - much cheaper than the local restaurant supply house. High density polyethelene buckets will have HDPE stamped on them, or a recycle symbol with a \"2\" in the middle. DISCLAIMER: I\\'m only passing on information I received from the manufacturers. I am in no way professing these things to be absolute fact! ------------------------------------------------------------------------ From: \"Jenny S. Johanssen\" johanssen@matnet.com Originally posted in: rec.food.preserving Denis - saw your comments on food grade buckets and thought I\\'d offer my solution. My son cooks at a local Mexican restaurant. They get all their strawberries (for the strawberry magaritas at the bar) in 3 gallon plastic buckets. Now you know how many margaritas pass through a Mexican bar each night - lots. So I asked my son to save me some buckets. They are ideal for storing flour, rice, I made (from my home grown raspberries) a delicious raspberry cordial in one of the buckets, another I made Raspberry wine in. My motto is why buy when you can recycle! Thanks for giving me the time and space to add my two-bits worth. - Jenny ------------------------------------------------------------------------ From: Woody Harper lager@primenet.com Originally posted: rec.food.preserving ...I get topping buckets from Dairy Queen and I have to make sure there is no trace of the strawberry syrup left. A little detergent and elbow grease followed by a chlorine solution bath keep everything nice and clean.-- A.2 PLASTIC PACKAGING Before we can intelligibly discuss plastic packaging it is necessary to understand what the substance we call \"plastic\" is. Plastics are produced from basic polymers called \"resins\", each of which have differing physical properties. Additives may be blended in to color them or to modify particular properties such as moldability, structural properties, resistance to light or heat or oxidation. Additionally, it is common for several different kinds of plastic to be laminated together each performing a particular desired task. One might offer structural rigidity and the other might be more impermeable to the transfer of gasses and odors. When bonded together a rigid, gas impermeable package can be made. Whether that package is safe for food use will depend on the exact nature of the additives blended into the plastic. Some of them, notably plasticizers and dyes, can migrate from the packaging material into the food it\\'s containing. This may be exacerbated by the nature of the food it\\'s in contact with especially if it is high fat, strongly acidic or alcoholic in particular. Time and temperature may also play a prominent role in the migration of plastic additives into food. For this reason, the (US) FDA assesses the safety of packaging materials for food contact and conducts toxicological studies to establish safety standards. Only plastics that are FDA approved for a particular food type should be used for direct contact with that food. Just being FDA approved, however, may not be all of the story. It must still be determined whether the particular plastic in question has the physical properties that would make it desirable for your purpose. As mentioned above each base resin has somewhat differing physical properties that may be modified with additives or combined by laminating with another plastic or even completely unrelated materials such as metal foils. An example of this is \"Mylar\", a type of polyester film. By itself, it has moderate barrier resistance to moisture and oxygen. When laminated together with aluminum foil it has very high resistance and makes an excellent material for creating long term food storage packaging. One or more other kinds of plastic with low melting points and good flow characteristics are typically bonded on the opposite side of the foil to act as a sealant ply so that the aluminized Mylar can be fashioned into bags or sealed across container openings. The combined materials have properties that make them useful for long term storage that each separately do not have. Probably the most common plastic that raises suitability questions is High Density PolyEthylene (HDPE). It\\'s used in a wide array of packaging and is the material that most plastic five and six gallon buckets are made of. It has a moderate rigidity, a good resistance to fats, oils, moisture and impacts, a fair resistance to acids, but is a poor barrier to oxygen. Whether it is suitable for your purpose depends on how sensitive to oxygen exposure your product is and how long you need it to stay in optimal condition. Foods such as whole grains are not particularly delicate in nature and will easily keep for years in nothing more than a tightly sealed HDPE bucket. Most legumes are the same way, but those that have high fat contents such as peanuts and soybeans are more sensitive to O2. Other foods such as dry milk powder might only go a year before deleterious changes are noticed. If that milk were sealed in an air-tight aluminized Mylar bag with the oxygen inside removed, the milk would probably go for two years or more. Better still would be to seal the milk in a metal can or glass jar. HDPE can still be used for long term storage, but with one or more of the following precautions to keep a high food quality: The food should either be put on a shorter rotation cycle than packaging also using a second gas barrier such as Mylar; be periodically opened and re-purged or fresh absorbers should be inserted. Some special plastics and plastic laminates have excellent oxygen and moisture barrier properties and are eminently suited to long term storage, but for home use they are not easy to find, though some used containers might be available for reuse.. A.2.1 HOW DO I GET THE ODOR OUT OF PICKLE BUCKETS? I\\'ve had fairly good luck doing it in the following way. Since vinegar is the primary smell in pickles and it\\'s acidic, we used a base to counteract it. First we scrubbed the bucket well, inside and out, with Dawn dish detergent. Most any sort will do. Then we filled the buckets with hot water and dissolved a cup of baking soda in each. Stir well, get the bucket as full as you can and put the top on. Put the bucket in the sun to keep it warm so the plastic pores stay open as much as possible. In a couple of days come back and empty the buckets. Rinse them out, fill with warm water again and add about a cup of bleach and reseal. Put back in the sun for another couple of days. Empty out and let dry with the tops off. We completely eliminated the vinegar smell this way. It might be possible to cut the time down a lot, but we haven\\'t experimented that much since we can\\'t get that many pickle buckets. A.3 METAL CANS Metal cans and glass jars being heat resistant, can both be used for heat processed, wet-pack foods and for non-heat treated dry pack canning. For wet foods, however, metal cans have several disadvantages for the do-it-yourselfer. They are hard to come by, and they take specialized equipment to use that can be difficult to locate. Probably the greatest flaw which makes them unpopular for home canning heat processed wet-pack food is that they can only be used once. Since the commercial canning industry is not interested in reusing the containers, metal cans make great sense for their purposes. The cans are both cheaper (for them) and lighter than glass jars. This adds to the economy of scale that makes canned foods as cheap as they are in the grocery store. For home canning, wet-pack heat processed foods glass jars are better because even the smallest of towns will usually have at least one business that carries pressure and boiling water canners along with jars, rings and lids. With metal cans a can sealer is necessary and this usually has to be ordered from the manufacturer or a mail-order distributor. A few of which are listed in the Resources section. Metal cans are not really made entirely of tin. They\\'re actually steel cans with a tin coating on the inside and outside. Some kinds of strongly colored acidic foods will fade in color from long exposure to tin so a type of enamel liner called \"R- enamel\" is used to forestall this. Certain other kinds of food that are high in sulfur or that are close to neutral in pH will also discolor from prolonged contact with tin. For those foods, cans with \"C-enamel\" are used. The excellent food preservation book, *Putting Food By* Chapter 6 (see reference list) has a section on the use of metal cans for wet packed foods. It is in dry-pack canning that metal cans for home use begin to come into their own. Because microbiological sterilization isn\\'t necessary, foods that are dry packed into containers do not have to be subjected to heat processing nor does the safety of their seals depend upon the vacuum that the cooling contents create. This means that other packaging methods and container types may be used. Probably the most common use of metal containers is the 10 cans such as are used by the LDS family canneries discussed below. This is not the only way they may be used though. It will probably take a bit of searching, but there are various food grade metal containers available of sufficient volume to make them useful for food storage. They usually have double friction lids similar to paint cans or screw caps like jars that can achieve an air-tight seal. If you can find them in a large enough volume capacity they can be of real use for storing bulky foods such as grains, legumes and sugar. Smaller cans of a gallon or less would be useful for storing items like dry milks. If properly sealed, metal cans have a far higher barrier resistance to gasses such as oxygen, CO2, and nitrogen than any plastic. Although they can hardly be considered portable the use of metal drums (not garbage or trash cans), either themselves food grade or used with food grade liners, is also a possibility. A fifty five gallon drum full of grain will weigh several hundred pounds, but may make for a much easier storage solution than multiple buckets. The advantage of using such a large container is that a great amount of a single product can be kept in a smaller amount of space and fumigating or purging the storage atmosphere would be simpler. The disadvantages are the difficulties of moving it and rotating the stock in the drum. If using oxygen absorbers make sure the drum you want to use is capable of making an air-tight seal, otherwise you should stick with carbon dioxide fumigation. A.3.1 POOLING RESOURCES: THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER DAY SAINTS -- THE MORMONS Although the purchase of a can sealer and metal cans for home use is not economically feasible for most people there is one way that it can be. This is by pooling community resources to purchase the equipment and supplies. It may even, in fact, not be necessary to form your own community to do this. If you live in the right area your local Latter Day Saints church may have facilities they will allow you to use. They may even have suitable food products to sell you. This is an offshoot of the church\\'s welfare programs and it is done in their family canneries. Rather than using plastic buckets they have gone over to using metal cans church-wide for dry-pack canning. By sharing the cost of the equipment and purchasing the cans in bulk quantities, they are able to enjoy the advantages of metal cans over plastic containers while minimizing the disadvantages of cost. As we approach the end of the Millennium, other groups, both religious and secular, are purchasing can sealers in order to facilitate their own food storage programs as well. *Please see VI.F.1 Organizations. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints -- LDS Family Canneries for more detailed information about where LDS Family Canneries may be found and how best to approach using them.* Any food products you want to have sealed in cans will need to fall within the LDS cannery guidelines of suitability for that type of packaging. This is for reasons of spoilage control since many types of foods just aren\\'t suitable for just sealing in a container without further processing. If you purchase food products from them, they will already be within those guidelines. *A brief treatment of these guidelines may be found in VI.F.1 LDS Family Canneries Guidelines.* Once you have your foodstuffs on hand, either supplying your own or by purchasing them from the cannery you\\'re ready to package them. It is here that using some forethought concerning your packaging system can save you much time and aggravation. With the Millennium coming upon us the traffic load of the canneries is really beginning to pick up. This means that access time to the can sealers and other equipment may be limited. IMPORTANT NOTE: Please do keep in mind that the individuals responsible for the family canneries are all *volunteers* with demands on their time from many areas. Be courteous when speaking with them and, if there are facilities for use, flexible in making arrangements to use them. You will, of course, have to pay for the supplies that you use, cans and lids at the least, and any food products you get from them. With the onset of the millennium the LDS family cannery volunteers are becoming quite busy so be prepared to have to work with their available scheduling. As a general rule they cannot put your food in storage for you. Be ready to pay for your purchases in advance, if necessary. They do not take credit cards and probably cannot make change so take a check along with you. The following is a list of suggestions to make the most efficient use of your access time: 1 - Make your appointment well in advance. Many people are beginning to make use of the canneries so making advanced reservations is a must. 2 - Have enough people to set up an assembly line type operation. Make sure each of your people knows what they need to do and how to do it. At least four people for any serious amount of food is a good number. Ask the cannery volunteer to go over the process with you and your crew. 3 - Make sure you have enough muscular helpers to do the heavy lifting so you don\\'t wear yourself out or hurt your back. Some of the supplies you will be working with, such as wheat, come in fifty pound bags and a box of 10 cans full of sugar or other weighty items are heavy. 4 - Make labels for the foods you are going to pack in advance. This will save time after the cans are filled. 5 - Take out only as many as oxygen absorbers as you can seal up in a half hour. They use up most of their capacity within two to three hours depending on temperature and humidity. You don\\'t want them to waste any by soaking up the oxygen in the room. The ones you don\\'t use up right away should be tightly sealed in a gas proof container. 6 - Save powdery food items such as dry milk powder, pudding mixes and grain flours and meals till last. They can be messy to can and this will keep them out of your other foods. 7 - Leave time to clean up after yourself. They are doing you the courtesy of using their equipment and selling you the supplies at cost. You should return the favor by leaving the place at least as clean as you found it. 8 - Always keep in the back of your mind just how much volume and weight your vehicle can carry. You\\'d hate to find you canned more than you could carry home. *See also IV.C.2 Preventing Corrosion of Canned Goods.* A.4 GLASS JARS Compared to metal cans, glass jars are very stable, although they obviously don\\'t take being banged around very well. The cardboard boxes most jars come in are well designed to cushion them from shocks. The box also has the added bonus of keeping damaging light away from food. The major advantage of glass jars is that they are reusable. For wet-pack canning the lids must be replaced, but the rings don\\'t. For dry pack canning even the lids may be reused probably indefinitely. When you get right down to the bottom line, it is seldom practical strictly in terms of dollars and cents to wet-pack your own food in jars. When you count the cost of your equipment, including the jars, rings, lids and all the rest, along with a not inconsiderable amount of your personal time, the cost of purchasing or growing your produce, you\\'ll almost always come out ahead to buy food canned for you by the commercial canning industry. That said, forget about the strict bottom line and examine more closely why you want to put up your own food. For many, gardening is a pleasure and they have to have something to do with the food they\\'ve grown! There\\'s also the fact that for many, you simply cannot buy the quality of the food you can put up for yourself. The canning industry tries to appeal to a broad spectrum of the general public while you can put up food to your own family\\'s specific tastes. Home canning is not so much about saving money as it is about satisfaction. You get what you pay for. If home canning appeals to you, please allow me to point you toward the *rec.food.preserving FAQ* where much very good information about methods and techniques may be found. Dry-pack canning using glass jars, on the other hand, may well make a great deal of economic sense. It is usually far cheaper per pound to purchase food in bulk quantities, but often unsuitable to store it that way. Breaking the food down into smaller units allows for easier handling and exposes a smaller quantity of food to oxygen and moisture before it can be used up. Of course, packaging used for doing this can be made of many different materials, but glass is often the easiest and most convenient to acquire and use. Used containers are frequently suitable and are often free or of little cost. One source of gallon sized glass jars are sandwich shops and restaurants that use pickles, peppers and other sandwich condiments. I have a Subway sandwich shop that saves its pepper jars for me and receive several per week. There are also half-gallon canning jars, though they are sometimes difficult to find. The brand I buy is made by Kerr. A.5 MYLAR BAGS The word \"Mylar\" is a trademark of the DuPont corporation for a special type of polyester film. Typically made in thin sheets, it has a high tensile strength and is used in a wide variety of industrial settings. In food storage, particularly for the long term, it is commonly found as a laminate with Mylar as the top layer, a very thin aluminum foil in the middle and one or more other types of plastic films on the bottom acting as sealant plies. This laminate combination possesses a high resistance to the passage of oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, other gasses and water vapor and is what makes it valuable for our purposes. Unfortunately, it has a poor puncture resistance so it must be used as an interior liner for more puncture resistant containers rather than as a stand- alone package. Food grade aluminized Mylar complies with US FDA requirements and is safe to be in contact with all food types except alcoholic. For food use, Mylar is most commonly available as pre-made bags of various sizes. Flat sheets or rolls of the material might also be found from which bags could be fashioned as well. When Mylar bags are used by the storage food industry they are generally for products sealed in plastic buckets. The reason for doing this is that the High Density PolyEthylene (HDPE) from which the pails are made is somewhat porous to gasses. This means that small molecules, such as oxygen (O2), can slowly pass through the plastic and come into contact with the food inside. The problem is further compounded if oxygen absorbers are used, as the result of their absorbing action is to lower the air pressure inside the container unless it has first been carefully flushed with an inert gas such as nitrogen. How fast this migration activity will occur is a function of the specific plastic formulation, its wall thickness and the air pressure inside the container. In order to gain the maximum possible shelf life a second gas barrier, the Mylar bag, is used inside the pail. Whether the use of these bags is necessary for your home packaged storage foods depends on how oxygen sensitive the food item is and how long you want it to stay fresh. If the container is made of a gas impervious material such as metal or glass then a second gas barrier inside is not needed. If it is HDPE or a plastic with similar properties and you want to get the very longest possible storage life (say 10+ yrs for grain) then Mylar is a good idea. If you\\'re going to rotate that grain in four to five years or less then it is not needed. Provided the oxygen has been purged from the container in the first place, either with a proper flushing technique, or by absorption, there will not have been sufficient O2 infiltration to seriously impact the food. Particularly oxygen sensitive foods such as dry milk powders that are to be kept in plastic containers for more than two years would benefit from the use of Mylar. Naturally, storage temperature and moisture content is going to play a major role as well. There is also the question of the seal integrity of the outer container. If you are using thin walled plastic buckets in conjunction with oxygen absorbers the resulting drop in air pressure inside the pail may cause the walls to buckle. If this should occur, there would be a risk of losing seal integrity, particularly if the buckets are stacked two or more deep. If the food was packed in Mylar bags with the absorbers inside this would keep the vacuum from seriously stressing the container walls. Better still would be not to have the problem at all by either using containers of sufficient wall thickness or flushing with inert gas before sealing. Wall thickness is one reason why the six gallon SuperPails have become so widespread. It should be noted that Mylar is not strongly resistant to insect penetration and not resistant at all to rodents. If mice chew through your buckets, they\\'ll go right through the bags. A number of retail dealers carry Mylar bags. Contact information may be found in the suppliers section. A.5.1 HOW DO I USE MYLAR BAGS? Sealing food in Mylar bags is a straight-forward affair, but it may take a bit of practice to get it right, so purchase one or two more bags than you think you\\'ll need in case you don\\'t immediately get the hang of it. 1 - The bags typically sold by storage food dealers look rather large when you compare them to the five or six gallons buckets they are commonly used in. That extra material is very necessary if you are to have enough bag left over after filling to be able to work with it. Unless you are very sure of what you are doing, don\\'t trim off any material. 2 - Place the bag inside the outer container and fill with the food product. Resist filling it all the way to the top. You need at least an inch or so below the bucket rim left open to get the lid to seat completely. 3 - When it seems to be full, gently thump the pail on the floor a few times to pack the product in and reduce air pockets. Add any makeup food necessary to bring level back to where it should be. 4 - Take the bag by the corners and pull out any slack in the material so that all sides can be pulled together evenly. Place your oxygen absorbers inside if you are going to use them. Now place a board over the top of the bucket and fold the bag end down over it keeping it straight and even. Place a piece of thin cotton fabric such as sheet or t-shirt material over the edge of the bag mouth. Using a clothes iron set on the cotton, wool or high setting run it over the cloth-covered Mylar about a half-inch from the edge for about twenty seconds or so until it seals. You\\'ll probably have to do the bag in sections. Experimenting on a left-over strip to find the right temperature setting is a good idea. 5 - When you\\'ve done the entire mouth of the bag allow it to cool. Once cool try to pull the mouth of the bag open. If it doesn\\'t come open, fold the bag down into the pail until you feel the trapped air pillowing up firmly against the material and wait to see if it deflates. If it doesn\\'t, then your seal is good. You can seal on the bucket lid at this point or take the further step to vacuum or gas flush the bag. Once a seal has been obtained the bags can be left as-is, vacuum sealed or gas flushed. To obtain the most efficient oxygen removal the bags can be first drawn down with a vacuum pump and then purged using an inert gas. VACUUM SEALING MYLAR BAGS Once you have obtained a good seal on the bag, pulling a vacuum on the contents is also pretty straight forward. First you\\'ll need something to make a vacuum with. This can be either a regular vacuum pump, a vacuum sealer such as the Tilia Food Saver or even the suction end of your household vacuum cleaner. The end that is to be inserted into the bag will need to be of fairly small diameter in order to keep the hole in the Mylar from being any larger than necessary. This means that if you use a vacuum cleaner you\\'ll need to fashion some form of reduction fitting. Cut a hole into the Mylar bag on a corner, making the opening only just large enough to admit the vacuum probe. Insert the nozzle and using a sponge, or something similar, push down on the material over the probe to make a seal. Now draw down a vacuum on the bag. It will probably only take a second or two. When it\\'s drawn down as much as possible, run a hot iron diagonally across the cut corner resealing the bag. GAS FLUSHING MYLAR BAGS. Flushing with inert gas works essentially just like vacuum sealing except that you\\'re putting more gas into the bag rather than taking it out. You\\'ll want to keep the entry hole small, but don\\'t make a seal around it as above. Beyond that, follow the directions as given in Section IV.B.2 - CO2 and Nitrogen. When you feel that the bag has been sufficiently flushed, run the iron across the corner just as above to seal. Flushing with dry ice can also be done, but it is important to wait until the frozen carbon dioxide has completely sublimated into gas before making the final seal otherwise the bag will burst like an overfilled balloon. A.6 REUSING OR RECYCLING PACKAGING In an effort to save money or because new packaging may be hard to come by, it is common for many people to want to re-use previously used containers. There is nothing wrong with this, but it is sometimes more complicated than just using new containers would be. Here are some general \"rules of thumb\" that can be used if you have an interest in doing this. 1. Do not use containers that have previously contained products other than food. There are two risks this can expose you to. The first is that the particular package type may not have been tested for food use and may allow the transfer of chemicals from the packaging into your food. The second is that all plastics are porous to some degree. Small amounts of the previous contents may have been absorbed by the packaging material only to be released into your food, particularly if it is wet, oily or alcoholic. 2. Previously used containers should only be used with foods of a similar nature and exposed to similar processes. This means that if a container previously held a material high in fat, such as cooking oil, then it should not be used to store a strong acid such as vinegar. Nor should a container be exposed to extreme conditions, such as heat, if the original use of the package did not subject it to that treatment. An exception to this is glass which is covered below. Generally speaking, dry, non-oily, non-acidic or alkaline, non-alcoholic foods may be safely contained in any food safe container. An example of this is keeping grains and legumes in HDPE buckets formerly containing pickles. 3. Glass may be used to store any food provided it is in sound condition and has only been used to store food previously. The lid or cap, however, that seals the jar is subject to the cautions given above. Glass jars not specifically made for home canning, either boiling water bath or pressure canning, have a significant risk of breakage if used for that purpose. 4. Porous packaging materials such as paper, cardboard and Styrofoam should not be reused. Their open texture can trap food particles and are very difficult to adequately clean. Packaging formerly holding raw meats or shelled egg products are particularly at risk. 5. Containers previously holding odorous foods may trap those odors and transfer them to foods later stored. Trust me, pickle flavored milk leaves a lot to be desired. Foods such as dry milk powders, fats and oils, flours and meals will absorb any odors seeping from your container material. Be sure to get the smell out before you fill them. B -- CO2 AND NITROGEN Carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen (N2) are commonly used in packaging both fresh and shelf-stable foods, in order to extend their usable shelf lives. Fresh foods are outside the scope of this work so attention shall be focused only on those foods suitable for use in storage programs. The most common use of these gasses is for excluding oxygen (O2) from the atmosphere contained inside of a storage container (called head gas). When oxygen levels can be dropped below 2% the amount of deleterious oxidation reactions in stored foods can be greatly decreased resulting in longer palatability and nutritional shelf lives. Actually achieving this low oxygen content is not a simple matter when limited to the equipment and facilities typically available in the home. With careful technique and proper packaging materials it is possible to achieve useful results though. In order for either gas to be used most effectively to gain the longest possible shelf life it is recommended that it be contained inside of packaging with high barrier properties to prevent it from diffusing out over time or allowing oxygen to infuse in. Examples of this kind of packaging are Mylar and other high barrier property plastics, metal cans and glass jars. Buckets made of HDPE plastic are poor gas barriers and will, over time, allow oxygen to infuse into the container. In order for foods to be kept for their maximum shelf lives the containers would need to be re-purged every three to four years. Foods that are particularly oxygen sensitive, such as dry milk powders, should not be stored in HDPE without a secondary gas barrier. It is possible to use HDPE buckets alone when gas purging if a shorter rotation period is used. An example would be using wheat in four to five years instead of the eight to ten that would be achievable if a high barrier container were used. Purging efficiency can be greatly improved when used with a vacuum device. By first drawing down the head gas of the container and then flooding with the purging gas much more oxygen can be removed from the container. Repeating the process once more will improve removal efficiency even more. If a true vacuum pump is not available, the suction end of a home vacuum-cleaner can be made to serve and still achieve useful results. With careful technique, oxygen levels can be dropped to be 0.5-2%. Finely textured materials such as grain flours and meals, dry milk powders and similar textured foods will purge poorly and are better packaged with oxygen absorbers. Instructions for vacuum usage are given in *A.5.1 Using Mylar Bags.* Instructions for gas purging are given below in *B.1 Dry Ice and B.2 Compressed Nitrogen*. A less common, but important use for carbon dioxide is fumigation. This is the killing or retarding of insect life contained in a product. Many chemical fumigants are available to do this but are not thought desirable by many who have foodstuffs they want to put into storage. CO2 is not as certain as the more toxic fumigants, but it can be made to work and will not leave potentially harmful residues behind. It is possible for nitrogen to work in a similar manner, but it must be in a head gas concentration of 99%+ whereas carbon dioxide can be effective over time at levels as low as 3%. The precise amount of time necessary for the gas to do its work will vary according to the specific species and growth stage of the insect along with the temperature and humidity level of the product being fumigated. In general, the more active the growth stage and the warmer the temperature the more effective CO2 is in killing weevil infestations. The gas also exhibits bacterial and fungal inhibiting properties, but for our purposes this will be of little moment since all foods should be too dry to support such growth in the first place. The procedure for fumigating foodstuffs with carbon dioxide is precisely the same as the one used in purging oxygen from storage containers mentioned below. The only change is that for the fastest effectiveness the sealed container should be left in a warm place for a week or so before moving it into its final storage location. The gas is still effective at cooler temperatures, but because insect life is slowed by lower temperatures the carbon dioxide takes longer to complete its mission. NOTE: Both Mitsubishi Gas-Chemical, maker of the Ageless line of oxygen absorbers, and Multisorb, manufacturer of the FreshPax D 750 absorbers, state the their products should not be used in a high carbon dioxide head gas environment. B.1 DRY ICE Using dry ice to displace oxygen from food storage containers is a very straightforward affair. To get the best purging results it is recommended that all foodstuffs and packaging materials be put in a warm location for a few hours before beginning the purging process. The reason for this is that the cold CO2 sublimating from the dry ice will be denser than the warmer, lighter oxygen containing air. The cold gas will tend to stay on the bottom, gradually filling the container and pushing the warm air out of the top. When you first pick your dry ice up from the supplier, put it in a moisture proof container so that water vapor will be less able to condense and freeze on it. The sublimating gas will prevent you from being able to tightly seal it, but you can slow down any water ice accumulation. Assemble the container and any interior packaging materials. Break off a piece of dry ice of sufficient size for the volume to be purged. One pound of dry ice will produce about 8.3 cubic feet of carbon dioxide gas so approximately four ounces per five gallon bucket will do. Wipe off any accumulated water frost which should look whiter than the somewhat bluish frozen gas. Wrap in a paper towel to keep foodstuffs out of direct contact. Place in the bottom of the container that will actually contain the food, i.e. the bag. Fill the package with the food product, shaking and vibrating while doing so to achieve the maximum packing density. If a vacuum process is not to be used then place the lid on the container, but do not fully seal. If a liner bag is being used then gather the top together or heat seal and cut off a small corner. This is to allow the air being purged to escape as it is pushed upward by the expanding gas from the dry ice. Do not move or shake the container while the ice is sublimating so as to minimize turbulence and mixing. After approximately two hours complete the seal. Check the container every fifteen minutes or so to be sure that a pressure build up is not occurring. A small amount of positive pressure is OK, but do not allow to bulge. If a vacuum process is used then cut off a corner of the bag and insert the probe or place the container in the vacuum chamber. Draw a vacuum and when it has reached the desired point shut it off, but do not allow air to get back inside. When the dry ice has finished sublimating seal the container. If a slightly larger piece of dry ice is used this process may be repeated once more to improve oxygen removal. Watch for pressure signs as above. NOTE: It is natural for some grains and legumes to adsorb carbon dioxide when stored in a atmosphere with high levels of the gas. This will result in a drop in head space air pressure much like using oxygen absorbers will cause as they absorb oxygen. Precautions should be taken in thin walled containers against buckling and possible loss of seal integrity. When the food products are removed from the container they will release the adsorbed CO2 and suffer no harm. WARNING: Dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide) is extremely cold and can cause burns to the skin by merely touching it. Because of this you should wear gloves whenever handling it. Also, dry ice evaporates into carbon dioxide gas, which is why we want it. CO2 is not inherently dangerous, we breath it out with every breath we take, but you should make sure the area you are packing your storage containers in is adequately ventilated so the escaping gas will not build to a level dangerous enough to asphyxiate you. IMPORTANT NOTE: Because dry ice is very cold, if there is much moisture in the air trapped in the container with it, and your food, it will condense. Try to pack your containers on a day when the relative humidity is low or in an area with low humidity, such as in an air-conditioned house. Use of a desiccant package when using dry ice to purge storage containers may be a good idea. B.1.1 DRY ICE SUPPLIERS Dry ice may be found at ice houses, welding supply shops, some ice cream stores, meat packers or you could look in your local phone book under the headings \"dry ice\" or \"gasses\". B.2 COMPRESSED NITROGEN B.2.1 TYPES OF AVAILABILITY Both nitrogen (N2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) are commonly available in the form of compressed gas in cylinders. In food storage, CO2 is mainly used in the form of dry ice (see above) which is often easier to acquire with much less equipment needed to use it. Because of this, I\\'ll be limiting this section to the use of compressed nitrogen. If for some reason you prefer to use compressed CO2 the information given below will work for it as well, though cylinder sizes may differ. In the U.S. there are about eight principal suppliers of compressed gasses: Air Liquide, Airco, Linde, Air Products, Matheson, Liquid Carbonic, MG Industries, and Scott. One or more of these producers should have compressed gasses available in virtually every area of the United States and Canada. Locating a source of compressed nitrogen is probably as easy as looking in your local phone book under the headings \"compressed gas suppliers\", \"gasses\", or \"welding supplies\". Other sources might be automotive supply houses, university or college research departments, vo-tech schools, and medical supply houses. Nitrogen is generally available in a number of forms ranging from gas intended for welding, to various purity assured types, to gas mixtures where N2 would be one of the components. Unless you are very knowledgeable about compressed gasses and the equipment needed to use them it is strongly recommended that you not use any gas mixtures in your food storage, but rather to stay with pure nitrogen gas. Use of compressed gas mixtures requires knowledge and equipment beyond the scope of this FAQ. IMPORTANT NOTE: Welding nitrogen is essentially a pure gas, but it has one important caveat. When a cylinder of welding gas is used there is an unknown possibility that some form of contaminant may have backfed into the cylinder from a previous user. Possibly this could happen if the tank was being used in an application where the cylinder\\'s internal pressure fell low enough for pressure from whatever the tank had been feeding to backflush into the cylinder. Alternatively, the tank pressure may have become depleted and was repressurized using ordinary compressed service air. The most likely contaminants will be moisture, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, oxygen and hydrocarbons, but there is the remote possibility of something even more exotic or toxic getting into your cylinder. Welding gas cylinders may not be checked by the gas supplier before being refilled and sent back out for use. It is this remote, but unknown possibility of contamination that causes me to recommend against the use of welding grade nitrogen in food storage. If your supplier is willing to certify that welding gas cylinders are checked before refilling then they would be OK to use. The varying types of purity assured nitrogen gas are slightly more difficult to find and slightly more expensive in cost, but I believe this is more than made up for by the fact you know exactly what you\\'re getting. Air Liquide, as an example, offers seven types of purity assured nitrogen ranging from 99.995% to 99.9995% pure with none having a water vapor content over 1 part per million (ppm) or an oxygen content over 3 ppm. Any of them are eminently suited to the task so the most inexpensive form is all you need buy. As you might expect, compressed gas cylinders come in a number of different sizes. For the sake of simplicity I will address only the most common cylinder sizes since they will almost certainly be the most inexpensive as well. Again using Air Liquide as an example, it is their size 44 and 49 cylinders that are the most common. There are other cylinder sizes of smaller physical dimensions and capacities. However, the logistics of compressed gas production and transport being what they are, they frequently will cost as much or even more than the larger, more common sizes. The actual gas inside the cylinder is fairly cheap. Filling and moving the heavy cylinders around is not. --------------------------------------------------- Table 1.

As you can see, the size 49 cylinder from Air Liquide has an equivalent from all eight manufacturers. This size is the one commonly seen being used to fill helium balloons at county fairs and ball games. B.2.2 OBTAINING THE GAS AND NECESSARY EQUIPMENT Although you can purchase your own cylinder the most inexpensive way to use nitrogen is to rent a cylinder from your gas supplier. This may require filling out an application, paying a refundable cylinder deposit and buying the gas contained in the cylinder. Tank rental periods can vary, but the most common is for thirty days. Having rented or purchased the cylinder you must now get it home. Delivery by the supplier can often be arranged or they may assist you in getting the cylinder into your vehicle. The preferred method of transportation is for the cylinder to be chained, clamped or otherwise solidly secured in a vertical position in the transporting vehicle with the cylinder cap in place. Transportation requirements vary from nation to nation, state to state and even city to city so your best bet is to inquire of your gas supplier to find a safe and legal means of moving the tank. IMPORTANT NOTE: The major expense in using compressed gas is not the cost of obtaining the gas itself, but in the equipment needed to safely handle and control it. Unless you can borrow the appropriate mechanisms they will have to be purchased, new or used, and even the cheapest regulator and gauge are not inexpensive. There is a temptation to forgo the expense and not use a regulator, but I must caution strongly against this. As table 1 above shows, a full cylinder of compressed gas will have an internal pressure of 2000+ PSIG. Normal atmospheric pressure is about 15 PSIA. If the cylinder valve was opened only slightly too far a great deal of very high pressure gas will flow through the delivery hose and metal wand and the potential for serious injury when it began to whip around would be very great. For your safety, get the necessary equipment. If you purchase your own regulator/gauge cluster and/or your own cylinder, there is necessity for periodic maintenance. Regulators and gauges need to be calibrated (using a water deadweight calibrator) and cylinders need to be hydrostatically tested, typically every ten years for both. Your gas supplier can provide you with more detailed information. The only equipment that will come with your cylinder is the cylinder cap. \"Don\\'t leave home without it\" and they mean it. All of the common cylinder sizes will use the CGA-580 (Compressed Gas Assembly) cylinder fitting. The downstream side of this fitting can be obtained with different threads, but a 1/4\" NPT (National Pipe Thread) nipple is normally needed to mate with the regulator body. The nipple is really nothing more than just a short length of high pressure pipe. The CGA fittings come in a variety of metal compositions such as carbon steel, stainless steel and brass. The best choice is one which matches the composition of the regulator body. If the CGA fitting and regulator are to be used only with dry, non-oxygen gasses, in a dry environment then galvanic corrosion can be disregarded so the most inexpensive metal composition can be used even if it is not the same as the regulator. If it is to be used in a wet area, or with oxygen containing gasses then matching metal composition becomes very important. When the tank is to be returned there must be some residual pressure still in the cylinder or the renter might have to pay a surcharge or lose their deposit. This is particularly true of purity assured gasses because the residual gas composition will be analyzed. This is done for the safety of all cylinder users. The regulator/gauge cluster should be carefully removed using the same procedure that is described below to put it all together. Care should be taken not to damage the cylinder valve threads. Replace the cylinder cap and transport in the same manner as you brought it home. B.2.3 PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER If the fitting and regulator are bought separately then some 1/2\" wide Teflon tape is recommended for assembly since it is a clean and inexpensive way of sealing pipe joints. Looking into the open end of nipple wrap the tape clockwise around the threaded end for 1.5 to 2 turns, working from the open end backwards. If you want to do a neat looking job, the tape may be slit lengthways to make it 1/4\" wide, but this is not a requirement. A brass nipple may shrink somewhat during tightening and need a bit more tape than a harder metal like stainless steel would. The Teflon tape should only be used on the end of the nipple that attaches to the regulator body, NOT to any part of the cylinder end. The regulator end has tapered threads and uses them directly for sealing. The cylinder end has straight threads and depends upon the precision mating of machined metal surfaces to seal. The cylinder end threads simply apply the clamping force. Before attaching the CGA fitting to the cylinder the user should put on safety glasses and good hearing protection. The cylinder valve can then be cracked very slightly to blow out any dust or debris. After closing the valve, inspect the cylinder valve and nipple for any abrasions, nicks, gouges, embedded particles, etc., before attachment is made. You will need two wrenches (not adjustable pliers) to equalize the torque, particularly on the cylinder valve where it should be minimized. Put one wrench on the fitting and the other wrench on the cylinder valve and make the join. Once the regulator/gauge cluster has been mated to the cylinder, the delivery hose can now fitted to the regulator and the metal wand to the other end of the hose. The wand is nothing more than a short length of metal tubing at least six inches greater in length than the depth of the buckets to be filled. Copper water line works well. When the joins have been made, a mixture of a short squirt of dish washing detergent and water can be used to check for leaks. Be certain the detergent does not contain ammonia. Pour some on each fitting working from the cylinder end outward, opening each valve and pressurizing as you go. Once the leak check is finished rinse off and wipe down all surfaces to minimize the chance of accidents in the future. If the gas is not to be used at that time then the cylinder valve should be closed and all pressure should be drained to zero in the regulator and gauge. This should be done any time that the tank is not in actual use. If you have purchased your own cylinder then it is a good idea to also acquire one of the plastic valve plugs, similar to those seen with propane cylinders, in order to protect the cylinder valve threads and keep dust, debris and insects out of the valve. WARNING: Care should be taken that the cylinder is used and stored in such a way as to minimize the risk of the tank falling over. With the regulator and gauge attached there is an increased likelihood of damage occurring to the cylinder valve should the tank fall. Catastrophic failure of the cylinder valve will turn the tank into a high-energy, unguided rocket with the capability of doing great damage and/or serious injury. B.2.4 PUTTING IT INTO USE. Having assembled and tested your gas system, you are now ready to begin the work of packaging your food. You\\'ll need containers, and food grade plastic or Mylar bags that are a bit larger in internal volume than the container. Next is the dry food you intend to package and a pack of matches or a cigarette. You\\'ll also need to wear the safety glasses and hearing protection you wore when you put the gas system together. Take the containers you are going to use to store your food in, the bags that will line them and the food you are putting up and place them in some warm (not hot) area long enough for them all to equalize to that temperature. This will mean that the air contained inside them will also be at a warm temperature and make it more likely that it will stay on top when the cool gas from the nitrogen cylinder begins to flow in. The warm gas being on top will be the first to purge from the container, taking a good deal of the oxygen with it. Line the interior of the container with a plastic bag or Mylar bag. Fill the container with the food product shaking to get it as full as possible. Don\\'t forget to add your desiccant package if you\\'re going to use one. You don\\'t want any pockets left between the plastic bag and the container. Once you have gotten it full to just short of not being able to fully put on the lid, gather the top of the plastic bag together or heat seal the edges. If you have sealed it, cut a small corner off of the bag just large enough to allow a probe to enter. At this point you can either simply flush the bag as described below or draw a vacuum on it first and then flush. If using a vacuum the suction probe should be kept at the top of the bag, just inside of the opening. The gas wand should be inserted to the bottom of the container, taking care not to poke any holes in the liner bag. Once both instruments are inserted, draw the vacuum. When it has reached a satisfactory level, shut of the suction, maintain the seal and turn on the gas. Open the cylinder valve and set the regulator to a very slow gas flow and begin to fill the bag with gas. You want the container to fill slowly so you can minimize turbulence and mixing as much as you can. It\\'ll take a little while to fill each container, a few minutes per bucket. Just as with dry ice, the idea here is for the cool gas to displace the warmer atmosphere from the container. The bag should puff just a bit. When I think it\\'s full I\\'ll hold a lit match just above the bag in the air that is escaping from it. If it snuffs right out then I let it run for about several minutes longer to flush out more of any remaining oxygen and remove the wand. For the most efficient oxygen removal, repeat the suction/gas flushing procedure one more time. When satisfied, tie or heat seal the bag off and seal the bucket. Again, you want to have the bucket as full as possible so that there\\'ll be only minimal air space. You should monitor the containers for an hour or two after filling to check for any signs of bulging or other pressure build up as the cool gas inside gradually warms up and expands. A slight positive pressure is OK, but serious bulging needs some of the pressure released. NOTE: Although the procedure for flushing a container with nitrogen is straightforward enough, actually getting a good purge of the container is not. Nitrogen flushing works best when the contents of the container are fairly coarse in size so that the gas flow around and through the food is free and unrestricted. Foods such as the larger sized grains (corn, wheat, barley, long grain rice, etc.), legumes and non-powdered dehydrated foods are best suited to this technique. Foods with small particle sizes such as flours, meals, and dry milks will flush with mediocre results. Because of the difficulties in purging sufficient oxygen from a container to lengthen the shelf life of the food it contains many commercial suppliers have dropped this technique in favor of using oxygen absorbers. There is no reason that inert gas flushing and oxygen absorbers cannot be used together and one good reason that they should. If you are using five gallon plastic buckets as your storage containers, it has been observed that absorbers used in unlined pails can cause the air pressure inside the bucket to drop enough for the walls to buckle, possibly leading to a seal breach or a stack collapsing. For this reason, flushing with inert gas (nitrogen or CO2) might be a good idea, in order to purge as much oxygen as possible so that the pressure drop caused by the absorber removing the remaining oxygen will not cause the bucket to buckle. Liner bags can ameliorate the vacuum problems. C -- OXYGEN ABSORBERS C.1 WHAT IS AN OXYGEN ABSORBER? If all of this messing about with gasses sounds like too much trouble, you can try using oxygen absorption packets. I don\\'t know exactly when they first showed up on the market, but they are a relatively recent food storage tool. The packets absorb free oxygen from the air around them and chemically bind it by oxidizing finely divided iron into iron oxide. This removes it from being available for other purposes such as oxidative rancidity and respiration by insects, fungi or aerobic bacteria. The practical upshot of all this is that by removing the free oxygen from your storage containers, you can greatly extend the storage life of the foods in the containers. The absorbers themselves have only a relatively short life span, roughly about six months from the time they were manufactured for the types that do not need external moisture. Finding any information about these absorbers has been difficult, but, thanks to Al Durtschi, I was able to find a study of their effectiveness from Brigham Young University. The study tested the absorption capacity of the Ageless Z300E packets made by Mitsubishi Gas-Chemical. It found they were even more effective than their rated absorption capacity of 300 milliliters of oxygen (O2 at sea level pressure). A single packet sealed into an empty 10 can (80% of one gallon) reduced the oxygen in the canned air to less than 1/2%. The following is the verbatim text of the conclusions section of the Brigham Young study. See V.B Pamphlets for the complete citation of this study. Conclusions: \"Oxygen absorbing packets are effective in reducing oxygen contents in sealed cans. The ageless Z300 packet has a greater than claimed capacity for absorbing oxygen. Packets abused by 4 hour-exposure-to-air still exceed claimed capacity. It may be economical to use smaller packets based on the dead air volume instead of can volume. Smaller packets would have less tolerance for abuse and personnel would need to be more diligent in protecting the packets.\" \"The level of oxygen remaining in the presence of the absorber packets is sufficiently low to greatly retard development of rancidity. The biological consequences are not so easy to predict. Microorganisms range from aerobic to anaerobic, thus no unqualified statement can be made. The energy requirements of anaerobic bacteria are met by reactions between oxygen and more than one other molecule. This makes bacterial energy a higher order of reaction than rancidity. Thus, the rate of bacterial aerobic reaction would be more seriously retarded than rancidity. These matters are not of practical importance because the products to be canned should be too dry to support microbial growth. Insects are aerobic and would like-wise suffer retardation of activity. No comprehensive statement can be made about irreversible inactivation or death of insects. As long as the oxygen level remains low, insect activity will be lower by at least the square root of oxygen content. In a practical sense, these packets are effective in stopping insect activity. USDA does not recognize any method except disintegration as effective for completely killing insect eggs.\" Use of Oxygen Absorbers in Dry Pack Canning C.2 WHERE CAN I FIND OXYGEN ABSORBERS? Because they are a relatively new tool on the food preservation and storage market, oxygen absorbers have not yet achieved a widespread dissemination amongst the various storage food dealers and suppliers. They are available, but you may have to do a bit of searching to find them. The following short list are the suppliers I\\'ve located, thus far, who sell them: WALTON FEED BEST PRICES STORABLE FOODS DOUBLE SPRINGS HOMEBREW SUPPLY NITRO-PAK PREPAREDNESS CENTER SHERRY\\'S STOREHOUSE CSIN WWW.GLITCHPROOF.COM COUNTRYSIDE GRANARY In addition to the above suppliers it may be possible to acquire oxygen absorbers through a LDS family cannery if you have one locally available. *Please see section IV.A.2 for information on how to explore this possibility.* C.3 HOW ARE OXYGEN ABSORBERS USED? Even though the Z300E type will apparently absorb a great deal more than the 300 ml of O2 they are rated for, the following instructions for use are based on their listed rating. So, when using the Mitsubishi Ageless Z300E oxygen absorption packets, you should allow one packet for every quart and a half (1430 ml) of remaining air volume in your filled storage containers. The FreshPax D750 from the Multisorb Corporation work with just over 3 quarts (2860ml) of remaining air volume. Now determining the volume of air remaining in a filled container is no easy thing. In the study, 10 cans filled with either elbow macaroni or powdered milk were used and their respective air volumes were determined. A can full of elbow macaroni was found to contain 22% remaining air volume and a can full of powdered milk was found to contain 10.5%. With these as guides, you should then be able to roughly figure the remaining air volume of the foods you have in your containers. You\\'ll have to decide whether the food you are working is closer to the macaroni or the dry milk in its packing density. Obviously, this is a rather rule of thumb and this is why I kept my instructions to the listed ratings rather than on what they will apparently really do. The excess capacity will thus serve to cover the shortcomings of your reckonings. These absorption packets should be used only in dry foodstuffs and not with any product that will make them wet or oily. Your absorbers begin their removal mission the second they come into contact with oxygen, whether it be in your storage container or in the open air waiting to be used. Try to arrange things in such a way as to have your container packed and ready to go before exposing the packets. Take out only those you are going to be able to use up in no more than about fifteen minutes or so else you are losing valuable absorption capacity. When you take them out of their package, spread them out on a tray so they do not contact each other. The oxidation reaction that absorbs the oxygen releases small amounts of heat. The warmer the packet becomes the faster the reaction occurs so you do not want the packets warming each other. Handle each one with tongs, gloved hands or by the edges of the envelope to keep body moisture and skin oils off. Seal the lid or seam of the container as soon as the packets have been inserted. NOTES: 1 -- Both Multisorb and Mitsubishi corporations advise that their oxygen absorbers should not be used in a high carbon dioxide environment. I haven\\'t yet been able to determine if this is for reasons of chemical interaction between the CO2 and the oxidation reaction occurring in the absorber. 2 -- If you do choose to use oxygen absorbers in packing your food storage containers you should give some consideration to the container you\\'re using. The absorber is going be removing the 20% of the atmosphere that oxygen constitutes. Since nothing is replacing it this will leave the interior of the storage container with a lower atmospheric pressure than the outside. If the container is sufficiently sturdy this pressure differential will be of little consequence. For containers with thinner walls or more flexible material the pressure drop could cause them partially collapse or buckle, particularly if other containers are stacked upon them. This could make them more likely to lose seal integrity. Metal cans and glass jars should have no problems. Plastic buckets made of HDPE are poor gas barriers and should have a liner bag of Mylar or other high gas barrier plastic when used with absorbers. Seal the absorbers inside of the liner bag so that the pressure drop with not stress the walls of the container. Other containers should probably be tested or first flushed with an inert gas (N2) before the absorber is sealed in. 3 -- If the pack of absorbers you need to open contains more than you are going to use up in fifteen minutes or so, you should minimize exposure of the remaining packets. This can be done by heat sealing the bag they came in with an iron after expelling as much air as possible or better yet by vacuum sealing the bag. You can also put the remaining absorbers in as small a jar or metal can as they will fit in and closing with an air tight lid. 4 -- If absorbers are sealed in a package with desiccants some thought should be given to just how low the relative humidity will be dropped. Silica gel will reduce humidity to approximately 40% which should not interfere with the absorbers oxidation reaction. Other desiccants, however, are capable of reducing relative humidity to very low levels. This might adversely affect your absorber\\'s ability to carry out its mission by removing moisture from the absorber package that is necessary to sustain the oxidation reaction. D -- DESICCANTS D.1 WHAT IS A DESICCANT? Moisture in inappropriate amounts and places is very damaging to the useful life of food. Because of this, much effort is put into reducing the water content of dry foods in order to prolong their shelf lives. Once it is reduced to the desired level the product can then be packaged for storage. Unfortunately, merely reducing moisture content is not always sufficient. Environmental conditions can play a role as well. There are four mechanisms by which environmental conditions may cause a moisture problem in your food storage: 1. - The air trapped in the container with the food may have held sufficient humidity to raise the moisture content of the food to undesirable levels. 2. - Even if the water vapor content wasn\\'t too high, a falling temperature level may cause the trapped humidity to reach its dew point causing water to be squeezed out of the air to condense on your food much the same way as dew forms on your lawn on cool mornings after a warm, humid night. 3. - The seal of the container may not be sufficiently tight enough to prevent moisture from leaking in. 4. - The packaging material itself may be porous to one degree or another to water vapor. All paper, wood and cardboard has this fault. Depending upon their particular physical properties many plastics do as well. Metal and glass containers have excellent barrier properties though their seals may not. The solution for moisture problems is multi-faceted. First, make sure the product to be stored is at an appropriate water content for that particular foodstuff. Beans and grains store quite well at a 10% moisture level, but milk powders, dried eggs and dehydrated or freeze dried foods should be lower for best results. Secondly, try to package your goods in a cool, dry atmosphere and do not allow extreme temperature swings in storage areas. Warm temperatures and high relative humidities when a container is sealed means the air trapped inside the container will have a high dew point. This will lead to condensation should storage temperatures fall below that dew point. An example of this would be a container sealed on a day that was 70 deg. F and 40% relative humidity. At that temperature the relative humidity would be quite reasonable for all but the most moisture sensitive food. However, should the temperature fall to 44 deg. F the capacity of the air to hold water vapor would have dropped to the point that it could not contain what was sealed in at 77 deg. and the excess would be squeezed out to condense on the food, i.e. - it will get wet. Possibly the food will be able to adsorb this moisture without harm and then again, it may not. Thirdly, use appropriate packaging materials and make certain it is sealed correctly. If you are going to consume them in four to five years, storing grains, beans and peas in unlined HDPE buckets at normal humidities is fine. If you want to keep them at their best for ten years or more, the plastic the pail is made of is too porous to water vapor for best results and should have an interior liner of a material with better barrier properties. Dry milk powders should not be kept for more than a year in unlined HDPE, but can be kept for much longer in 10 metal cans, glass jars or Mylar bags. Naturally, even the most highly resistant packaging material is useless if its seal isn\\'t good so be sure you use good technique when making closures. Lastly, you may wish to consider using a desiccant if good humidity control at the time of packing is difficult or if you are not confident of the foods\\' moisture content or if the storage area is in a high humidity environment or if the packaging material does not have sufficiently high barrier properties. A desiccant is a substance with very \"hygroscopic\" properties, meaning it will soak up water vapor from the air surrounding it. A number of different substances are capable of doing this, but only a relative few of them are of practical use and fewer still are going to be readily available to the average person. Before elaborating on the different types that might be useful for our purposes it\\'s necessary to explain how to choose a desiccant. The U.S. military has done much of the best research on the use of desiccants in packaging and have largely set the standards by which they are judged. Each type of desiccant has temperature and humidity ranges where it performs best and particular physical and chemical characteristics that may need to be considered in relation to what you propose to do with them. The standard most applicable for what can be done in home food storage defines a unit of desiccant as *the amount of desiccant that will adsorb at least 6 grams of water vapor at 40% relative humidity at 77 deg. F (25 deg. C).* The following table gives the amount of desiccant necessary per square area for flexible containers such as Mylar bags or per volume of area for rigid containers such five gallon pails or 10 metal cans. The actual weight of a particular desiccant to use will depend upon the adsorbency per unit of desiccant mass. FLEXIBLE CONTAINERS RIGID CONTAINERS (Mylar and other (Buckets, cans, jars, etc.) plastic bags) Units of Volume in: Area sq ft Area sq in Desiccant Gallons Cu/FT Cu/In Required _________________________________________________________________ 0.1 30 1/6 1.1 0.14 237 0.3 45 1/3 2.1 0.28 476 0.6 90 1/2 3.2 0.42 714 1.3 180 1 6.2 0.83 1,428 1.9 270 2 12.5 1.67 2,856 2.5 360 3 18.7 2.50 4,284 3.1 450 4 25.0 3.33 5,712 [Table adapted from \"Moisture In Packaging: Selecting the Right Desiccant\" (c), Multisorb Corp. http://www.multisorb.com ] In order to maximize surface area to obtain optimal adsorption, desiccants are manufactured in granular or powder forms. This presents a problem of keeping the desiccant, which may not be safe for direct contact with food, out of the product while still allowing sufficient air flow for it to carry out its task. Manufacturers call this \"dusting\" and deal with it by packaging the adsorbent in materials such as uncoated Tyvek, a spunbonded high-density polyethylene material produced by the Dupont corporation. Unfortunately, I have not yet been able to locate a retail source of uncoated Tyvek, just the coated variety such as is used in postal envelopes. Second best, and what I use, is one or more layers of coffee filter paper securely sealed over the mouth of the container holding the desiccant. I\\'ve also made \"cartridges\" of filter paper for use in narrow necked containers such as two-liter bottles. For this I used ordinary white glue, but getting a good seal all the way around without sealing too much surface area requires some care in execution. For coarse granular materials tightly woven fabrics might serve the purpose providing the seams were adequate. D.2 TYPES OF DESICCANTS D.2.1 SILICA GEL The most commonly known and used desiccant is silica gel which is a form of silica dioxide (SiO2), a naturally occurring mineral. It will work from below freezing to past the boiling point of water, but performs best at room temperatures (70-90 deg. F) and high humidity (60-90%). Its performance begins to drop off over 100 deg. F, but will continue to work until approximately 220 deg. F. It will drop the relative humidity in a container down to around 40% at any temperature in its range until it is saturated. Silica gel will absorb up to 40% of its weight in moisture. It is the only desiccant that is approved by the FDA for direct food use. It recharges easily and does not swell in size as it adsorbs moisture. In the retail trade, the most commonly found form of silica gel is *indicating silica gel* which are small white crystals looking much like granulated sugar with small pink or blue colored crystals scattered throughout. This is ordinary silica gel with the colored specks being coated with cobalt chloride, a heavy metal salt. When the gel has absorbed approximately eight percent of its weight in water the colored crystals will turn from blue to pink making an easy visual indicator of whether the gel has become saturated with moisture. Because cobalt is a heavy metal, indicating silica gel is not food safe and should be kept from spilling into anything edible. When saturated, silica gel can be dried out and used again. This is accomplished by heating the crystals in an oven at a temperature of no more than 300 deg. F for approximately three hours or until the crystals turn blue. Dehydrating the desiccant may also be accomplished by heating in a microwave oven. Using a 900 watt oven heat the crystals for three minute intervals until the color change occurs. The exact amount of time necessary will depend upon the oven wattage. Spreading the desiccant in a broad pan in a shallow layer will speed the process Heating to 325 deg. F or more, or by using a microwave oven over 900 watts can damage the gel. Although I\\'ve never found anything that mentions this, apparently it is possible for silica gel to break down over time, or at least the colored crystals can. I had a five pound can stored in an outside shed here in Florida for several years before I opened it again to use some of it. Nearly all of the colored indicator specks had broken down and disappeared. I don\\'t know if the gel itself was still good and with no way to reliably determine whether it was saturated or not, I discarded it. The can the gel was in was just cardboard and it gets very humid here in Florida so it really was very poorly stored. Under decent conditions it may not break down at all. (I\\'ve never heard of this occurring, anyway.) D.2.2 CLAY DESICCANT Although not typically found for sale on the retail market, clay desiccant is fairly common in commercial and industrial use. The primary reason for this seems to be that it is inexpensive compared to any other form of desiccant. The material is *Montmorillonite clay*, composed primarily of magnesium aluminum silicate, a naturally occurring mineral. After mining it is purified, reduced to granules and subjected to a controlled dehydration process to increase its sorbent porosity. It recharges easily and does not swell as it adsorbs water vapor. It works well at low and room temperatures, but has a rather low ceiling temperature. At 120 deg. F it will begin to desorb or shed the moisture it has adsorbed. This is an important consideration for storage in hot areas. Subject to a degree of variability for being a natural material, clay desiccant will adsorb approximately 25% of its weight in water vapor at 77 deg. F and 40% relative humidity. D.2.3 CALCIUM OXIDE Also known as \"quicklime\" or \"unslaked lime\", calcium oxide is a slow, but strong adsorbent. It is efficient at low humidities and can drop moisture vapor to below 10% relative humidity. Qucklime is *caustic* and must be carefully handled, particularly with regards to dust inhalation and exposure to skin and eyes. It expands as it soaks up water vapor and this must be taken into account when packaging it. It will adsorb up to about 28% of its weight in moisture, but does it slowly over a period of several days rather than a matter of hours like other desiccants. It is most effective when used in high humidity environment where a very low level is desired. It will release a great deal of heat if exposed to direct (liquid) moisture or extreme humidities. It can be recharged, but I do not have any details on how to go about this other than roasting at fire temperatures. For expedient use, quicklime can be manufactured from clean, pure lime stone or pickling lime available in the canning sections of many grocery and hardware stores. D.2.4 CALCIUM SULFATE Also known as the mineral gypsum and commercially as Drierite, calcium sulfate is another naturally occurring mineral. It is produced by the controlled dehydration of gypsum (CaSO4). It is chemically stable and does not readily release its adsorbed moisture. It has a low adsorbency capacity, only approximately 10% of it weight. It can be regenerated, but apparently not easily so. For expedient use, gypsum is commonly used in household drywall and Kearny mentions using this source in his Nuclear War Survival Skills. D.2.5 OTHER DESICCANTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------- From: Pyotr Filipivich pyotr@coho.halcyon.com Simple trick is to dry a piece of wood in the oven and once it is bone dry (more than usual) then put it in your container and seal it. The wood will suck up any available moisture. Editors note: Wood can soak up to 14% of its weight in moisture, depending on species. Woods with coarse, open grains work the best. I\\'m not aware at what temperature it will begin to \"desorb\" or shed its stored water and it might be fairly low. Some empirical experimentation would be in order before relying heavily on it. D.3 WHERE DO I FIND DESICCANTS? I buy indicating silica gel at Wal-Mart in their dry flower section where it is sold in one and five pound cans for flower drying. I\\'ve seen it sold the same way in crafts stores and other department type stores that carry flower-arranging supplies. You can also buy it from many other businesses already prepackaged in one form or another to be used as an adsorbent. All of the desiccant that I\\'ve found packaged this way has been rather expensive (to me) so shop carefully. Businesses carrying packaging supplies sometimes also sell desiccants. Some businesses commonly receive packets or bags of desiccants packaged along with the products they receive. I\\'ve seen Montmorillonite clay in bags as large as a pound shipped with pianos coming in from Japan. Small packets of silica gel seem to be packed in nearly everything. Naturally, any salvaged or recycled desiccant should be of a type appropriate for use with the product you want to package. It is possible to make your own desiccants using gypsum from drywall and maybe Plaster of Paris. Calcium oxide can also be produced from limestone (calcium carbonate) or slaked or pickling lime (calcium hydroxide) by roasting to drive off the adsorbed water and carbon dioxide. I don\\'t have any clear instructions, as of yet, on how to go about this. Please do keep in mind that calcium oxide (quicklime) is caustic in nature and is hazardous if handled incorrectly. D.4 HOW DO I USE DESICCANTS? Ideally, the dry foodstuffs you have on hand will have no more than a 10% moisture content. If they do not then you will need to reduce moisture to a level appropriate for the kind of food you are storing. One of the following methods might be of use in lowering moisture content. The least involved is to wait until the driest time of year for your location making sure there is plenty of free air circulation around the food product. If this doesn\\'t suit, then turn your air conditioning on a little high. Bring in your buckets, lids, and the storage food. Let everything sit in a well-ventilated place where it\\'s going to get plenty of cool, dry air from the A/C (avoid anywhere near the kitchen or bathroom areas, as they put out a lot of moisture). Stir the food frequently to maximize moisture loss. About three days of cool, constant air flow and low humidity ought to dry things out a bit. Due to its highly odor absorptive nature, I would not do this with any dried milk products or other powdered foods, flours or meals . This method works best with coarse particles such as grain, legumes and dried foods. Warm, dry air can also be used to accomplish this and works well if you have large quantities of grains and legumes. It is very similar to what is used on farms for drying harvested grain. You\\'ll need a source of forced, warm, *not hot*, air. Place the grain in a drum or barrel and blow the heat from the bottom so that the warm and the moisture it will carry can exit from the top. It\\'s important to not let the bottom product get too hot. You should also monitor the top, center of the drum to be certain that the product there is not getting too damp from the moisture escaping from other areas. Stirring occasionally may be necessary. I\\'ve seen this done with an old, drum style vacuum cleaner that put off fairly warm exhaust air and it worked pretty well. Do be sure to clean the vacuum so you don\\'t blow the grain full of dust. If the above methods won\\'t do or you have powdery foods to dry, you can place a large quantity of desiccant in a storage container. Fill the remaining space with your food product and seal on the lid. After about a week, unseal and check the desiccant. If it\\'s saturated, change it out with dry desiccant and reseal. Continue to do this until the contents are sufficiently dry. Calcium oxide will work particularly well for this. If it doesn\\'t become saturated the first time, change it anyway before sealing the bucket permanently. You\\'d hate to find later it saturated in storage. If your food products are sufficiently dry you can pack them in storage containers using the packaging method of your choice and have a reasonable expectation of your food staying in good condition. Whether you will need to use a desiccant will be dependent upon the conditions discussed above. I use indicating silica gel for practically everything. My usual procedure is to save or scrounge clear plastic pill bottles, such as 500ct aspirin bottles or small plastic jars, such as the smaller sizes of peanut butter comes in. Fill the bottle with the desiccant (remember to dry the gel first) and then use a double thickness of coffee filter paper carefully and securely tied around the neck of the bottle to keep any of it from leaking out. The paper is very permeable to moisture so the gel can do its adsorbing, but it\\'s tight enough not to let the crystals out. This way moisture can be safely adsorbed. It won\\'t dry out a lot of moisture -- you still need to take steps to get everything as dry as possible before you pack it -- but it will take care of what little is left. The above method will also work for the other desiccants, subject to whatever precautions the individual type may have. IMPORTANT NOTE: The indicating form of silica gel (has small blue or pink specks in it) is not edible so you want to use care when putting together your desiccant package to insure that is does not spill into your food. E -- DIATOMACEOUS EARTH E.1 WHAT IS DIATOMACEOUS EARTH? Diatomaceous earth is a naturally occurring substance comprised of the fossilized remains of marine diatoms. These diatoms are microscopic in size and are covered in sharp spines that make them dangerous to exoskeletal insects, but not to animals with internal skeletons. The spines of the diatom skeletons pierce the soft body tissues of insects between their hard exoskeletal plates and it is through these numerous microscopic wounds that the insect loses bodily moisture to the point of desiccating and dying. Creatures with internal skeletons such as humans, cattle and pets have means of resisting such damage and are not harmed. Thus, it is possible to mix a small amount of DE into your stored grains and beans to control insects without having to remove the dust again before you consume them. E.2 WHERE DO I FIND D.E. AND WHAT TYPE SHOULD I BUY? IMPORTANT NOTE: There are actually two kinds of diatomaceous earth to be found on the market and only one of them is suitable for use as an insecticide to use in your stored grains. The kind that you DO NOT WANT FOR FOOD USE is the type sold by swimming pool suppliers as a filtering agent. It has been subjected to a heat treatment that dramatically increases it\\'s silicate content and makes it unsuitable for use with your foodstuffs. The type that you want is sold by a number of suppliers as a garden insecticide. Many organic garden suppliers will carry it. Read the label carefully to be certain no deleterious substances such as chemical pesticides have been added. An appendix with the names and addresses of some DE suppliers may be found in the food and equipment suppliers section. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ From: higgins10@aol.com (Higgins10) Originally posted in: rec.gardens Good afternoon all. Diatomaceous earth is approved by the USDA as an animal feed additive, however I have found out that there are vast differences between various forms of diatomaceous earth. Some DE products may not be effective in controlling insects, while others may be harmful to humans and pets. The most important differences between individual forms of DE is the shape of the diatom, content of Crystalline Silica, and the purity of the Silica Dioxide. The World Health Organization cautions that DE with a crystalline silica content of three percent or higher is dangerous to humans, (and probably pets and birds as well). Diatomaceous Earth used in swimming pool filters has close to a 60% crystalline silica content. I know of a product called Organic Solutions (insecticide) which is approved by both the EPA and USDA and has a crystalline silica content ranging between 0.36% to 1.12% according to its labels etc. It is classified as Amorphous Fresh Water Diatomaceous Earth (whatever that means). However, all literature I have read assures it is safe for both humans and animals and seems to be very effective at killing insects. I stumbled across all this info. while shopping in the mall. If you\\'re interested in reading it too, go to the Organic Solutions website at http://www.BuyOrgs.com. Hope this helps answer the question and always use environmentally safe products! Higgins10 ------------------------------------------------------------------------- From: kahless@ns.waymark.net Date: Sat Aug 24 14:08:48 1996 To: Dunross (A.T. Hagan) Private e-mail [previous text deleted] I have always purchased DE at the local feed store. It\\'s cheaper there than at the garden and hardware stores. The feed store I buy at has DE available in bulk, but they\\'ll package up a smaller amount if that\\'s what you want. My package in the garage doesn\\'t have a brand name but says \"Nitron Industries\" at the bottom. The label recommends 7 pounds of DE for each ton of grain. Ha! As if I had \"tons\" of grain in storage 8-D I\\'ve been using DE for grain storage for about 15 years now but flea control only for the past 6 years. The only fleas we\\'ve seen in that period of time is the ones that hitch a ride in with friends pets. A very light dusting afterward takes care of that problem. Miracle stuff as far as I\\'m concerned since we\\'d had an awful time with fleas before we started using DE. Much much much cheaper and as far as I\\'m concerned the advantages FAR outweigh the risks. Sam (hope that was helpful) E.3 HOW DO I USE D.E. IN FOOD STORAGE? To use, you should mix thoroughly one cup of DE to every forty pounds of grain, grain products or legumes. You need to make certain that every kernel is coated so it is better to do the mixing in small batches where you can insure more even coating. WARNING: DE is a very powdery kind of dust, so you need to take steps to keep it out of your lungs and eyes. Even whole wheat flour dust can cause lung irritation if you breath enough of it. DE does not kill the insect eggs or pupae, but it will kill adults and larvae and any eggs or pupae that hatch into adults will die after coming into contact with it. ======================================================================= -- V -- SHELF LIVES ======================================================================= \"How long will this keep?\" This is the defining question of food storage. Everything you will read in this work evolves from this central question. The length of time a particular food will remain palatable and nutritious in storage determines its usefulness for our purposes. The fact of the matter is that there are few hard and clear answers. As a result it is not uncommon to find two or more sources who purport to know, but that give conflicting data. The following will hopefully cut through some of the fog. A. \"BEST USED\", \"USE BY\" AND OTHER FOOD PRODUCT DATES Although there are some twenty States in the U.S. that have food product dating laws the Federal government has little regulation concerning food product dating except for infant formulas and some baby foods. It does, however, require that if a manufacturer puts a calendar date on a food product it must also put wording to the effect of \"use by\" or \"best before\" next to it to explain what the date means. This is called \"open dating\" which is to say that it is a plain, easy to read calendar date rather than \"closed or coded dating\" that must be deciphered. Another date also commonly seen is the \"sell by\" date. While not as useful for food storage, it does have importance for day-to-day fresh food purchases. Because the Federal government has so few food product dating standards manufacturers use their own to determine acceptable shelf lives. For the most part, they are based upon changes in texture, appearance, taste and cooking qualities. When a food item begins to exhibit signs of aging that would make it unappealing to customers then it is considered to be at the end of its marketable shelf life. Look for statements such as \"use by\", \"best if used by\", \"best if used before\" or similar wording to find this date. For shelf stable and frozen products it must include both the month, day and year. These dates are useful for determining how long a product can be retained in the storage program before it should be rotated out. When a food begins to undergo taste and appearance degradation the nutrient content will have begun to seriously fade and the time will have come to use it up so it can be replaced with fresh stock. If the product was properly preserved and not subjected to extreme storage conditions it is not unsafe to use after this date. If there is nothing to replace it with it may be kept, but its palatability and nutritive content will just continue to degrade. Fresh food items such as meat, milk and eggs use a \"sell by\" date which simply means that the item should not be purchased beyond that date. Products using this date type are only required to use the day and month. Provided that it was properly transported and stored, an item kept past this date is not unsafe to use, but will begin to exhibit signs of aging that will make it unappealing and should be frozen or consumed shortly thereafter. NOTE: The shelf life of any food, whether indicated with a \"use by\" or \"sell by\" date or found on some chart, is predicated upon assumed storage conditions. If the actual storage conditions are different from the assumed storage conditions then the shelf life will naturally vary. As is explained in *Section I: Time, Temperature, Moisture, Oxygen and Light*, environmental storage conditions have a major impact on the length of time any foodstuff will remain palatable, nutritious and even whether it will remain safe. As a general rule, when a shelf life is given, it is for conditions of 70 deg. F in a dark, dry location unless stated otherwise. Be sure to read the fine print on any shelf life chart you may come across to see what its values are predicated upon. There are some floating around giving shelf lives of foods in storage temperatures as low as 40 deg. F. At that temperature you would expect to keep your fresh butter, eggs and milk, but very few have the ability to keep any significant amount of canned goods in so cool a storage area. Regardless of what the date or chart may indicate, if storage conditions have been very poor then a food will become non-nutritious, unpalatable, perhaps even unsafe to eat even if its listed time is not yet up. An example of this would be keeping egg salad at room temperature for several hours at a picnic. The eggs may have been laid yesterday, but you are taking your chances if you eat it. Never put blind faith in any date. Always keep in mind that they are predicated on unspoken assumptions. IF THE CONTAINER IS BULGING, MOLDED, FOUL SMELLING OR SPEWS LIQUID WHEN OPENED, THROW IT OUT! But throw it out safely so that children and animals cannot get into it. *Please see Section III: Spoilage for further information* B. CLOSED DATING CODES USED BY SOME FOOD MANUFACTURERS. In spite of the fact that increasing numbers of food processing companies are moving to open dating it is not yet universal. For those products that do not come with a plain \"best used by\" date it is still possible, albeit with much more difficulty, to determine the rotation period for that specific product. For a processor to move their product in interstate commerce it must exhibit a packing code. This allows them to easily track their product for purposes of stock rotation and in the event of a recall. These packing codes are usually a series of letters and numbers that indicate dates, times, and sometimes places of manufacture. These dates are not \"use by\" dates, but the time the container was actually filled. As they are not really intended for general public knowledge these codes are frequently unique to a particular processor and are not commonly published by them. It is possible to get the keys to these codes by contacting the processor and asking how to decipher the dating code for specific product lines. Over time, readers have been doing this and the code keys below are the ones that have been sent to me. Obviously, they are only a few of the many, many products that use closed dating and I hope that future readers will continue to send these codes in as they are gleaned from the processors. Frankly, when it comes to the potential dozens of products that would require deciphering their packing codes the entire process is a major nuisance. While it is better to have an encoded date than not to have one at all, it would be far better if processors would just use clear open dating and (best used by) so we wouldn\\'t have to carry a book of code keys like covert agents every time we go to the grocery. Before I list specific manufacturers there is one fairly widely used code key that may be useful. Some processors use a system where all the days of the year are listed 1-365 (366 for leap year) as the first three digits in the code. This number is then followed by a single letter such as \"B\" and then by a single digit that represents the year. Some examples of this might be: Packing code Date packed 045B97 February 14, 1997 101H98 May 1, 1998 134K96 July 4, 1996 252U98 October 31, 1998 There may be other widely used coding systems yet to be discovered and as they become available I will include them in this work. SPECIFIC PRODUCT LINES: IMPORTANT NOTE: I have not personally verified all of these code keys. Also, closed date coding schemes may change over time. For this reason, the code keys given below may not be correct. Be sure to check a number of containers in a product line to verify that a particular code key will work with the product line you are interested in. ARMOUR STAR CANNED MEAT PRODUCTS Vienna Sausage, Stew, Chili, Deviled Ham, Potted Meat, Slice Dried Beef, Soups, etc. but does NOT include Armour Star Roast Beef or Corned Beef. The code is on the bottom of the container. The first letter is the month of production; A=January, B=February, C=March and so on. The following two numbers represent the day of the month it was processed and the third number indicates the year. Example: A code of B148C23 would be B=Feb, 14 = the fourteenth day, 8=1998. B148C23=February 14, 1998 and the last three characters would be plant or processing line locations. Armour Star Microwaveable Meals have a two line production code on the container lid. The second line is the is date and uses the same code as above. BERTOLLI OLIVE OIL Packed two years prior to the use by date on the bottle or can. BUSH BROTHERS & CO. Baked beans, chili, etc. A five digit code on the bottom of the can. The first digit is the month, the next two digits is the day of the month, the next number is the year and the last digit is ignored. Example: A code of 50173 deciphers to be: 5 = the fifth month or May 01 = the first day of May 7 = 1997 3 = last number is discarded. Thus 50173 is May 1st, 1997. CAMPBELL SOUPS: Best by date on cans. Filled exactly two years prior to that date. DEL MONTE Canned fruits, vegetables, etc. I\\'m not sure if it applies to *all* product lines. A five character packing code, usually on the bottom. The first character is a digit representing the year. The next three characters are digits representing the day of the year the product was packed. The last character is a letter and may be ignored. Example: A packing code of 8045B deciphers to be: 8 = 1998 045 = The 45th day of the year or February 14th. B = A plant code. Thus 8045B is February 14th, 1998. GENERAL MILLS: The manufacturing date is coded to their fiscal year that begins on June 1st and ends on May 31st. Interpret the code as follows: The first character of the code is a letter and represents the month the product was made. The second character in the code is a number which represents the year the product was made. The following two characters are numbers that represent the day of the month the product was made. The remaining characters following identify plant location and shift information. Example: A packing code of E731B would translate as follows: E = October 7 = 1997 31 = 31st day of the month B = A plant location The following is their 12 month cycle. The letter \"I\" is not used because it can be confused with the number \"1\". A = June E = October J = February B = July F = November K = March C = August G = December L = April D = September H = January M = May HANOVER FOODS CORP. Small whole potatoes, green beans, corn, etc. A five digit code on the bottom of the can. Omit the first digit. The next digit is the year. The remaining three digits are the day of the year the product was packed. Example: A code of 28304 deciphers to be: 2 - discard this number 8 = 1998 304 = the 304th day of the year or October 31st Thus 28304 is October 31st, 1998 HEALTHY CHOICE: First character is a number, second is a letter with the remaining characters being a lot ID. The number is the year it was packed with the letter being the month, October = A, November = B, December = C, January = D, and so on through the year. The recommended shelf life is 2 years. HORMEL PRODUCTS Their packing code is a letter followed by five numbers. The letter is their plant location and the numbers are the dating code in a MM-DD-Y format. Example: A code of G07048 decodes to mean: G = plant location 07 = July 04 = The fourth day of the month 8 = 1998 The can was packed July 4, 1998 at plant location G. JELL-O BRAND PUDDINGS & GELATINS The first four digits are the date coding. The first digit is the year and the following three digits is the day of the year. Example: A packing code of 804522 10:38 deciphers as: 8 = 1998 045 = the 45th day of the year or February 14th 22 = discard the last two digits. 10:38 = the time it was packed. Thus 804522 10:38 means that box of pudding mix was packed on February 14th, 1998 at 10:38 a.m. McCORMICK HERBS & SPICES: (See also http://www.mccormick.com/info/oftenasked.html ) There should be a four digit number of the bottom of the spice package or extract bottle. On foil packages, it will be around the outside edge. This code is more complicated than other manufacturers so read closely. Example: Using a number 3604 as the packing code: To derive the year, take the first number and add 5 (3 + 5 = 8) so 1998 is the year of manufacture. To derive the month and day, divide the last three digits by 50 (604 50 = 6 with 4 remaining). The six indicates the last whole or \\x01 complete month before the month of production, January, February, March, April, May, and then June. The next month, July, is the production month. The 4 remaining is the day it was produced. Therefore a packing code of 3604 means that product was packed July 4, 1998. While not as precise, you can save considerable time by just finding the year. The last three digits representing the day and month will increase as the year grows. PROGRESSO FOODS Canned soups, beans, etc. Two lines of code on top of the can. The top line, the first two characters are the date portion. The first character is a letter indicating the month and the second character is a digit indicating the year. Example: A packing code of L7N18 1211 (this is the first line) would be: L = 12th month or December 7 = 1997 N18 = ignored 1211= ignored. Thus a packing code of L7N18 1211 indicates the can was packed in December of 1997. C. SHELF LIVES OF SOME COMMON STORAGE FOODS. The chart given below has been adapted from a number of different shelf-life charts published by the cooperative extension services of several states. It presupposes no special packagings other than the way the food comes from the store. The general assumption is that when a given foods\\' taste, appearance or texture begin to take on noticeable changes it has reached the end of its best marketable shelf life and should be rotated out. This is not to say the food is no longer edible, but it is losing nutritional content at the same time so no purpose is served by keeping it for longer than is necessary to replace it with fresher stock. For what it\\'s worth, I\\'m not fully in agreement with it myself, but it\\'s a good working hypothesis and I modify it by my personal experience which may vary from yours. If it is a dry food then only dry utensils should be used to remove it from its container. The less light, moisture, heat and oxygen it comes into contact with, the longer the food will keep. All of the below are for new, unopened containers. RECOMMENDED STORAGE TIME FOOD AT 70 deg. F.

The first spreadsheet is a nutritional calculator showing the breakdown of 65 nutrients for 167 foods with more being importable. The second spread sheet is a yearly supply calculator. http://waltonfeed.com/self/plan.html A nutritional calculator that allows you to enter your food supply and it gives you a daily nutritional printout. This is a smaller, less versatile version of the one from Revelar below, but is less resource intensive and will run on a DOS only machine. http://www.revelar.com/fsp.html A more extensive, versatile version of the above program, makes it much easier to modify for personal use. It also requires at least a 486, Windows and 8mb of Ram. A version for the Mac is available as well. http://www.beprepared.com (click on free software area) Offered on the Emergency Essentials web site. The first program is a food planner demo for creating shopping lists and planning recipes for any length of time. The second is a 72 hour preparedness program that will take you through various disasters and how to prepare for them. http://www.millennium-ark.net/News_Files/Hollys.html http://www.ballarat.net.au/~standeyo/News_Files/Hollys.html The U.S. and Australian web sites for Holly and Stan Deyo. They offer food storage calculators similar to the one from Revelar, but with more food items already built in. F. ORGANIZATIONS F.1 THE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF LATTER DAY SAINTS The LDS church, commonly known as the Mormon Church, has long had a welfare program for the benefit of its members in need. Believing that the best way to deal with the problem of needy members is not to have any, the church also strongly encourages its membership to be as self-reliant and self-dependent as possible. To further this end it provides access to church owned cannery facilities and makes large, economical bulk purchases of storage foods to sell at cost to any member with an interest in starting a personal food storage program. Believing that the more self-dependent people there are in general the fewer there will be needy in times of hardship the LDS church also makes those same facilities and supplies accessible to non-church members, or \"gentiles\", as well. Most facilities will be located at one of the LDS Bishop\\'s Storehouses located in various places around the country, but some churches will also have their own local facilities. The easiest means of finding out is simply to ask the LDS church member you know. If they don\\'t themselves know, or you don\\'t know any Mormons then a little phone book research will be necessary. Find your nearest local Mormon church and ask about speaking with the local Bishop of the Ward or Relief Society president. Either one of those two individuals will be able to give you the information you seek. Failing any of the above, you can also call the LDS church headquarters in Salt Lake City at 1-800-453-3860 extension 4164. Or you can write to: The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints Welfare Services Seventh Floor 50 East North Temple Street Salt Lake City, Utah 84150 If you find that you have a cannery within striking distance then give them a call. Inquire about available times, what you need to provide and what is not suitable for canning. Be up front and honest with them, they\\'re sincere about allowing non-church members to use their facilities. You\\'ll hardly be the first one to want to talk to them about food storage. Ask for a copy of the cannery guidelines and a price list of what is available. There may also be classes or seminars available. There is a certain degree of variability between the canneries so what is available at one may not be at another. I\\'ve corresponded with many LDS members and have even contacted the LDS headquarters in Salt Lake City to get the official word. Keeping in mind that not every area may have facilities for use and that the family canneries are run by volunteers, they are quite earnest about allowing non-church members to use their facilities. It\\'s worth investigating. IMPORTANT NOTE: Please do keep in mind that the individuals responsible for the family canneries are all *volunteers* with demands on their time from many areas. Be courteous when speaking with them and, if there are facilities for use, flexible in making arrangements to use them. You will, of course, have to pay for the supplies that you use, cans and lids at the least, and any food products you get from them. With the onset of the millennium the LDS family cannery volunteers are becoming quite busy so be prepared to have to work with their available scheduling. As a general rule they cannot put your food in storage for you. Be ready to pay for your purchases in advance, if necessary. They do not take credit cards and probably cannot make change so take a check along. Any food products you want to have sealed in cans will need to fall within their guidelines of suitability for that type of packaging. This is for reasons of spoilage control since many types of foods just aren\\'t suitable for just sealing in a container without further processing. If you purchase food products from them, they will already be within those guidelines. A brief treatment of these guidelines may be found below. F.1.1 LDS FAMILY CANNERY GUIDELINES Subject to some variability, the following foods are generally available at the canneries: Apple slices, dried Macaroni Rice, white Beans, pinto, pink, Milk, non-fat dry Soup mix great Northern Oats, quick rolled Spaghetti Carrots, dry Onions, dry Sugar, white Cocoa, hot mix Pudding mix Wheat berries Flour, white (chocolate & vanilla) (hard red winter) Fruit drink mix You will be able to purchase the necessary cans, oxygen absorbers, boxes and plastic lids for what you want to can. The following food items are not thought to store well when dry pack canned and generally cannot be put up at the cannery: Baked goods Egg noodles Peanut butter Baking powder Flour, whole wheat Rice, brown or soda Granolas Spices Barley, pearled Honey Sugar, brown Cereal, milled grain Mixes, if they contain Yeast Coconut leavening agents Cornmeal Nuts, roasted or raw Dried meats Oils or fats Although I am not in complete agreement with the above list, it is workable and will get the job done. Make sure that the food you want to pack has little fat content and strive to make sure it has a low moisture content and you should be OK. For grains, legumes, flours, meals and dried fruits and vegetables do make sure to use the oxygen absorbers. You should not assume the food is insect free. When the packets remove the available oxygen any insect life in the can will either die or at least go into stasis. G. FOOD AND EQUIPMENT SUPPLIERS G.1 MAIL ORDERING STORAGE FOODS -- WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW When it comes to building a food storage program, sooner or later you may want to seriously consider mail ordering at least a part of the foods you want. Even for those of us who try do as much as we can locally there are some things which are not going to be easily available in our areas. To help with this I have included below a list of food and equipment suppliers where just about anything can be found. Because many do find it necessary or desirable to purchase through mail order I am including a few points which should be considered before shelling out the cash. 1.-- Find out how much the shipping costs are going to be. Grains and legumes are relatively cheap, but weigh a lot when bought by the five or six gallon-bucket. Because of this, shipping charges can sometimes as much as double the actual cost of the product by the time you get it to your door. Adding insult to injury is the $2.00 per round bucket fee UPS is charging. Compare carefully each company\\'s list price and their shipping charges, combined, when deciding who to order from. Saving up for a larger order, or trying to find someone to combine orders with might enable you to make a large enough order to get a price break on shipping. You could also take a vacation in the area of the company\\'s location or swing through the area on the way back from one. If you choose to do this, be certain to call ahead and let them know so they\\'ll have your order ready and waiting for you. The company in the next state may be higher on the list price, but end up being cheaper than having it shipped in from six states away. 2.-- Ask the supplier when your order is going to ship. Some suppliers are way behind in order filling and you could be waiting and waiting. Slowness in shipping is not necessarily a sign of bad business. Some suppliers may drag their feet, but others may be genuinely swamped by the volume of business they are receiving because they have a good product at a fair price. The closer we come to the millennium the worse this problem is going to become. 3.-- How fresh is the product you are ordering? Freshness is what it\\'s all about when it comes to storage foods. If a food has a five year shelf life in its container then you want as much of those five years to be on your shelf, not the supplier\\'s. 4.-- Be very clear as to how the product you are ordering is packed. Many suppliers offer identical foods packed in several different ways. Be certain the product number you are giving the salesperson is for the product packed in the manner in which you want it. 5.-- What is the head gas analysis? If you are ordering foods packed in a nitrogen flushed oxygen free container (with or without an oxygen absorber packet added) then ask about the laboratory test results that measure the oxygen content of the head gasses in the container. This is of great importance if you are counting on the extra storage life such packaging will give you. There are but a few companies such as Perma Pak, Ready Reserve, and Walton Feed that actually produce packaged storage foods and most dealers only distribute and retail their products. If the dealer can not produce the manufacturer\\'s test data measuring the head gasses of the products they are selling then keep looking. 6.-- If you are purchasing wheat and intend to use it primarily for bread making then be sure to ask about its protein content. The best breads need at least 12% protein and the higher the better. Also take a close look at the weight of the product. One company\\'s five or six gallon bucket of wheat may not weigh the same as another\\'s. The same applies to dehydrated foods such as fruits, vegetables, TVP, etc. Ask about the moisture content of bulk foods which are not already packaged for long term storage. 10% moisture is where you want to be for grains, legumes and most everything else. 7.-- What is the company\\'s damage and return policy? If your carefully packed SuperPails and 10 cans get dented or cracked in shipping you\\'ll need to have them replaced. Most mail order companies will require you to contact the shipper (such as UPS) for a claim number. The shipper may or may not require an inspection so don\\'t destroy any packaging or containers until you know for sure. Does anyone else know of anything else a person should look out for or ask about when mail ordering storage food? G.2 ADDRESSES OF SUPPLIERS DISCLAIMER: The addresses listed below were either found by me or sent to me by the business owners or interested readers. I make *NO* representation as to their worthiness to do business with. Most of these merchants or manufacturers have been in their field for many years and will be around for many more and are honorable in their dealings. However, there are some businesses that spring up and then disappear and with every update of this work there is at least one or two that I cannot locate from the previous update. The advent of the World Wide Web has only exacerbated this problem. In addition to the precautions mentioned in G.1 above you should take all of the usual precautions in mail or phone ordering. I have accumulated the following list of names and addresses of various suppliers of one thing or another relating to food preservation and storage. They are roughly categorized by type: STORAGE FOOD MANUFACTURERS: The actual producers or packagers of storage foods. Some also do retail sales of their products, but most do not. FOOD PRESERVATION DEALERS AND SUPPLIERS: These are businesses dealing with the aspects of food preservation as opposed to storage. Canning, meat curing, fermented milks, pickling, spices, soybean products, brewing, vintning, etc. FOOD STORAGE AND PRESERVATION EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS: The actual manufacturers of equipment. Some will do retail sales and some do not. DIATOMACEOUS EARTH MANUFACTURERS AND DEALERS: Self-explanatory. STORAGE FOOD RETAIL DEALERS: Retail sales of all of the above. Naturally, addresses, phone numbers, web sites, etc change over time so if you have more current information than I\\'m giving here, please be so kind as to let me know. Additionally, I\\'m always looking for new companies so if you have some that I don\\'t have I\\'d like to see those too. Thanks - ed. G.2.1.

Hagan P.O. Box 140008 Gainesville, Fl 32614-0008 --- Content from Copy of Food and Water in an Emergency --- Food and Water in an Emergency Uae 1a) Red Cross Sole UTA RC eC Uo If an earthquake, hurricane, winter storm, or other disaster strikes your community, you might not have access to food, water, and electricity for days or even weeks. By taking some time now to store emergency food and water supplies, you can provide for your entire family. Emergency Food Supplies Even though it is unlikely that an emergency would cut off your food supply for two weeks, consider maintaining a supply that will last that long. You may not need to go out and buy foods to prepare an emergency food supply. You can use the canned goods, dry mixes, and other staples on your cupboard shelves. Be sure to check expiration dates and follow the practice of first-in, first-out. PREPARING AN EMERGENCY FOOD SUPPLY As you stock food, take into account your family’s unique needs and tastes. Familiar foods are important. They lift morale and give a feeling of security in times of stress. Try to include foods that they will enjoy and that are also high in calories and nutrition. Foods that require no refrigeration, water, special preparation, or cooking are best. 2 Individuals with special diets and allergies will need particular attention, as will babies, toddlers, and the elderly. Nursing mothers may need liquid formula, in case they are unable to nurse. Canned dietetic foods, juices, and soups may be helpful for ill or elderly people. Make sure you have a manual can opener and disposable utensils. Don’t forget nonperishable foods for your pets. STORAGE TIPS \\uf077 Keep food in a dry, cool spot—a dark area if possible. \\uf077 Open food boxes and other re-sealable containers carefully so that you can close them tightly after each use. \\uf077 Wrap perishable foods, such as cookies and crackers, in plastic bags and keep them in sealed containers. \\uf077 Empty open packages of sugar, dried fruits, and nuts into screw-top jars or air-tight canisters for protection from pests. \\uf077 Inspect all food for signs of spoilage before use. \\uf077 Throw out canned goods that become swollen, dented, or corroded. \\uf077 Use foods before they go bad, and replace them with fresh supplies, dated with ink or marker. Place new items at the back of the storage area and older ones in front. 3 SHELF-LIFE OF FOODS FOR STORAGE The following provides some general guidelines for replacement of common emergency foods. Use within six months: \\uf077 Powdered milk - boxed \\uf077 Dried fruit \\uf077 Dry, crisp crackers \\uf077 Potatoes Use within one year, or before the date indicated on the label: \\uf077 Canned condensed meat and vegetable soups \\uf077 Canned fruits, fruit juices, and vegetables \\uf077 Ready-to-eat cereals and uncooked instant cereals \\uf077 Peanut butter \\uf077 Jelly \\uf077 Hard candy and canned nuts \\uf077 Vitamins May be stored indefinitely (in proper containers and conditions): \\uf077 Wheat \\uf077 Vegetable oils \\uf077 Dried corn \\uf077 Baking powder \\uf077 Soybeans \\uf077 Instant coffee, tea, and cocoa \\uf077 Salt \\uf077 Noncarbonated soft drinks \\uf077 White rice \\uf077 Bouillon products \\uf077 Dry pasta \\uf077 Powdered milk – in nitrogen-packed cans 4 IF THE ELECTRICITY GOES OFF... FIRST... Use perishable food from the refrigerator, pantry, garden, etc. THEN... Use the foods from the freezer. To limit the number of times you open the freezer door, post a list of freezer contents on it. In a well-filled, well-insulated freezer, foods will usually still have ice crystals in their centers (meaning foods are safe to eat) for at least two days. Check to make sure the seal on your freezer door is still in good condition. FINALLY... Begin to use non-perishable foods and staples. 5 HOW TO COOK IF THE POWER GOES OUT For emergency cooking indoors, you can use a fireplace. A charcoal grill or camp stove can be used outdoors. You can keep cooked food hot by using candle warmers, chafing dishes, and fondue pots. Use only approved devices for warming food. Canned food can be eaten right out of the can. If you heat it in the can, be sure to open the can and remove the label before heating. Always make sure to extinguish open flames before leaving the room. WHEN FOOD SUPPLIES ARE LOW If activity is reduced, healthy people can survive on half their usual food intake for an extended period and without any food for many days. Food, unlike water, may be rationed safely, except for children and pregnant women. If your water supply is limited, don’t eat salty foods, since they will make you thirsty. Instead, eat salt-free crackers, whole grain cereals, and canned foods with high liquid content. NUTRITION TIPS During and after a disaster, it is vital that you maintain your strength. Remember the following: \\uf077 Eat at least one well-balanced meal each day. \\uf077 Drink enough liquid to enable your body to function properly (two quarts or a half gallon per day). \\uf077 Take in enough calories to enable you to do any necessary work. \\uf077 Include vitamin, mineral, and protein supplements in your stockpile to ensure adequate nutrition. 6 Emergency Water Supplies Having an ample supply of clean water is a top priority in an emergency. A normally active person needs to drink at least two quarts (half gallon) of water each day. People in hot environments, children, nursing mothers, and ill people will require even more. You will also need water for food preparation and hygiene. Store at least one gallon per person, per day. Consider storing at least a two-week supply of water for each member of your family. If you are unable to store this quantity, store as much as you can. If supplies run low, never ration water. Drink the amount you need today, and try to find more for tomorrow. You can minimize the amount of water your body needs by reducing activity and staying cool. 7 It is recommended to purchase food-grade water storage containers from surplus or camping supplies stores to use for water storage. If you decide to re-use storage containers, choose two-liter plastic soft drink bottles – not plastic jugs or cardboard containers that have had milk or fruit juice in them. The reason is that milk protein and fruit sugars cannot be adequately removed from these containers and provide an environment for bacterial growth when water is stored in them. Cardboard containers leak easily and PREPARE AND STORE AN EMERGENCY SUPPLY OF WATER To prepare the safest and most reliable emergency supply of water, it is recommended that you purchase commercially bottled water. Keep bottled water in its original container, and do not open it until you need to use it. Store bottled water in the original sealed container, and observe the expiration or “use by” date. If You Are Preparing Your Own Containers of Water... 8 are not designed for long-term storage of liquids. Also, do not use glass containers, because they are heavy and may break. \\uf077 Thoroughly clean the bottles with dishwashing soap and water, and rinse completely so there is no residual soap. \\uf077 Additionally, for plastic soft drink bottles, sanitize the bottles by adding a solution of 1 teaspoon of non-scented liquid household chlorine bleach to a quart (1/4 gallon) of water. Swish the sanitizing solution in the bottle so that it touches all surfaces. After sanitizing the bottle, thoroughly rinse out the sanitizing solution with clean water. \\uf077 Fill the bottle to the top with regular tap water. (If your water utility company treats your tap water with chlorine, you do not need to add anything else to the water to keep it clean.) If the water you are using comes from a well or water source that is not treated with chlorine, add two drops of non-scented liquid household chlorine bleach to each gallon of water. \\uf077 Tightly close the container using the original cap. Be careful not to contaminate the cap by touching the inside of it with your fingers. Write the date on the outside of the container so that you know when you filled it. Store in a cool, dark place. \\uf077 Replace the water every six months if not using commercially bottled water. Preparing Containers Filling Water Containers 9 HIDDEN WATER SOURCES IN YOUR HOME Safe water sources in your home include the water in your hot- water tank, pipes, and ice cubes. You should not use water from toilet flush tanks or bowls, radiators, waterbeds, or swimming pools/spas. You will need to protect the water sources already in your home from contamination if you hear reports of broken water or sewage lines, or if local officials advise you of a problem. To shut off incoming water, locate the main valve and turn it to the closed position. Be sure you and other family members know beforehand how to perform this important procedure. To use the water in your pipes, let air into the plumbing by turning on the faucet in your home at the highest level. A small amount of water will trickle out. Then obtain water from the lowest faucet in the home. To use the water in your hot-water tank, be sure the electricity or gas is off, and open the drain at the bottom of the tank. Start the water flowing by turning off the water intake valve at the tank and turning on a hot-water faucet. Refill the tank before turning the gas or electricity back on. If the gas is turned off, a professional will be needed to turn it back on. EMERGENCY OUTDOOR WATER SOURCES If you need to find water outside your home, you can use these sources. Be sure to treat the water according to the instructions on the next page before drinking it. \\uf077 Rainwater \\uf077 Streams, rivers, and other moving bodies of water \\uf077 Ponds and lakes \\uf077 Natural springs Avoid water with floating material, an odor, or dark color. Use saltwater only if you distill it first. You should not drink flood water. 10 WAYS TO TREAT WATER The instructions below are for treating water of uncertain quality in rare emergency situations in the absence of instructions from local authorities when no other reliable clean water source is available and you have used all of your stored water. If you store enough water in advance, you will not need to treat water using these or other methods. In addition to having a bad odor and taste, contaminated water can contain microorganisms (germs, bacteria, and viruses) that cause diseases such as dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis. You should treat all water of uncertain quality before using it for drinking, food preparation, or hygiene. There are many ways to treat water, though none are perfect. Often the best solution is a combination of methods. Boiling or chlorination will kill most microorganisms but will not remove other contaminants such as heavy metals, salts, and most other chemicals. Before treating, let any suspended particles settle to the bottom, or strain them through layers of paper towel, clean cloth, or coffee filter. Boiling Boiling is the safest method of treating water. In a large pot or kettle, bring water to a rolling boil for 1 full minute, keeping in mind that some water will evaporate. Let the water cool before drinking. Boiled water will taste better if you put oxygen back into it by pouring the water back and forth between two clean containers. This will also improve the taste of stored water. You can use household liquid bleach to kill microorganisms. Use only regular household liquid bleach that contains 5.25 to 6.0 percent sodium hypochlorite. Do not use scented bleaches, colorsafe bleaches, or bleaches with added cleaners. Because the potency of bleach diminishes with time, use bleach from a newly opened or unopened bottle. Chlorination 11 Add 16 drops (1/8 teaspoon) of bleach per gallon of water, stir and let stand for 30 minutes. The water should have a slight bleach odor. If it doesn’t, then repeat the dosage and let stand another 15 minutes. If it still does not smell of bleach, discard it and find another source of water. Other chemicals, such as iodine or water treatment products (sold in camping or surplus stores) that do not contain 5.25 to 6.0 percent sodium hypochlorite as the only active ingredient, are not recom\\xad mended and should not be used. While the two methods described above will kill most microorganisms in water, distillation will remove microorganisms that resist these methods, as well as heavy metals, salts, and most other chemicals. Distillation involves boiling water and then collecting the vapor that condenses back to water. The condensed vapor will not include salt or most other impurities. To distill, fill a pot halfway with water. Tie a cup to the handle on the pot’s lid so that the cup will hang right- side-up when the lid is upside-down (make sure the cup is not dan\\xad gling into the water), and boil the water for 20 minutes. The water that drips from the lid into the cup is distilled. (See illustration.) Distillation 12 Disaster Supplies Kit In the event you need to evacuate at a moment’s notice and take essentials with you, you probably will not have the opportunity to shop or search for the supplies you and your family will need. Every household should assemble a disaster supplies kit and keep it up to date. A disaster supplies kit is a collection of basic items a family would probably need to stay safe and be more comfortable during and after a disaster. Disaster supplies kit items should be stored in a portable container(s) near, or as close as possible to, the exit door. Review the contents of your kit at least once per year or as your family needs change. Also, consider having emergency supplies in each vehicle and at your place of employment. The following should be included in your basic disaster supplies kit: \\uf077 Three-day supply of nonperishable food and manual can opener. \\uf077 Three-day supply of water (one gallon of water per person, per day). \\uf077 Portable, battery-powered radio or television, and extra batteries. \\uf077 Flashlight and extra batteries. \\uf077 First aid kit and manual. \\uf077 Sanitation and hygiene items (hand sanitizer, moist towelettes, and toilet paper). \\uf077 Matches in waterproof container. \\uf077 Whistle. \\uf077 Extra clothing and blankets. \\uf077 Kitchen accessories and cooking utensils. \\uf077 Photocopies of identification and credit cards. \\uf077 Cash and coins. \\uf077 Special needs items such as prescription medications, eye glasses, contact lens solution, and hearing aid batteries. \\uf077 Items for infants, such as formula, diapers, bottles, and pacifiers. \\uf077 Tools, pet supplies, a map of the local area, and other items to meet your unique family needs. 13 Learn More The Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Community and Family Preparedness Program and American Red Cross Community Disaster Education are nationwide efforts to help people prepare for disasters of all types.

.................................................................................................................................................................12 Introduction Spend any amount of time in the outdoors and you have probably found that mealtime is full of trade-offs. Do you choose foods that fuel your body or foods that satisfy your taste buds? Do you spend the extra time to prepare a real meal or grab a protein bar on the go? Freezer Bag Cooking minimizes these trade-offs by changing the concepts of traditional outdoor food. It offers simplicity, convenience and variety. The cooking gear needed is minimal, lightweight and can be bought, found or even made. Meals are prepared at home and put into zip top freezer bags. When ready to eat, the meal is prepared in and eaten out of the freezer bag. Mealtime becomes fast, effortless and cleanup is as easy as licking your utensil and sealing the zip top bag. Also, with meals portioned into individual freezer bags, making meals for multi-day trips, families or a group is painless. Supplies Needed ► A backpacking teakettle or lightweight pan with lid to boil around 2 ½ to 3 cups water. Any metal is fine, and it doesn\\'t need to be coated. ► A simple canister or alcohol stove. A windscreen for your stove made of a turkey pan, stove liner pan or heavy- duty foil folded 3 times. This will increase fuel efficiency. ► A spoon to eat with. Forks can be used very carefully if eating pasta dishes. ► A mug/cup with measuring markers on it (Lexan is clear so you can use it as a measuring cup/drinking cup). Or a lightweight Titanium mug. Both work well for measuring water, and are light, yet hold up to abuse. ► A box of good quality freezer bags. Glad bags that are a greenish blue color or Ziploc bags. ► A ‘cozy’ consisting of a piece of cloth to insulate the freezer bag (wool scarf, knit cap or other suitable material). When getting ready to “cook” your meal, bring your water to a boil. Pour the water into your cup, measure, then add it to your freezer bag. This way you avoid painful burns, adding too much water, or touching your freezer bag with a burning hot piece of metal-and having the small potential of melting the bag. Stir with a Lexan or plastic spoon. After you have mixed it well, zip up the bag tightly and wrap in a fleece hat, jacket or cozy made for the purpose. Then let sit for 5-15 minutes, make yourself a drink, stir real well, and eat. Put the freezer bag into a cozy before adding the water, this works well as you don\\'t have to hold the bag upright while adding the water. If you squeeze or knead your bags to mix up the food, be very careful- be sure you have pushed out all the air before you do this. The steam from the hot liquid can cause a build up and your kneading could cause the bag to pop open. After your food is ready, roll the top 1/3 of the bag down (imagine you are cuffing socks). This will make your bag into it\\'s own bowl. If you are planning on making soups in a cozy...it never hurts to carry some instant mashed potatoes to thicken if it is too watery. If you are making a lot of rice dishes it doesn\\'t hurt to carry a little extra instant rice, in case it is too thin. Or add about 2-3 packets Parmesan cheese to help thicken. Keep on hand in bulk or boxes: ► Instant Rice ► Couscous ► Instant refried beans ► Cheese sauce powder ► Dried minced onions ► Dried veggie mix ► Dried Bell Peppers ► Dried Tomatoes, flaked ► Dried Mushrooms ► Soup mixes, such as cup of soup, and Knorr soup mixes ► Gravy packets ► Stuffing mix ► Pouches of tuna, salmon, cans of chicken, turkey, hamburger pouches ► Crystal Light To Go packets ► Ramen noodle pouches ► A vast assortment of packets of condiments. I keep them in sandwich bags by type. Carry with you in a small Ziploc bag: ► A couple salt and pepper packets from a fast food place. ► A couple packets of Parmesan cheese. ► Herbs/spices such as Thyme, Garlic, dried parsley, etc. Single Serving Condiment Packets Organize packets in sandwich bags by type of condiment. Rotate your stock, and for items like mayo and dressings, use them up in couple months or toss them. ► Honey: Starbucks, KFC. ► Butter and its imitators: KFC, Popeye’s, McDonalds ► Ketchup & mustard: fast food places ► Salsa/picante sauce: McDonalds and convenience stores ► Ranch tubs: McDonalds, KFC, Hidden Valley Dressing in 4 packs at the grocery store ► Parmesan Cheese& Red Chilies: Costco and Sams Club food courts, any pizza joint ► Jam packets or tubs: Burger King, McDonalds, continental breakfasts at motels ► Soy Sauce & sesame seeds: your favorite Chinese place ► BBQ Sauce: KFC, Popeye’s, McDonalds ► Salt and pepper packets: almost any place ► Mayonnaise and relish packets: stores that sell fried foods or deli\\'s in grocery stores ► Arby\\'s is great for horseradish sauce and BBQ sauce ► Most McDonalds\\'s and KFC have moist towelettes in packets ► Papa John\\'s is great as they will sell you tubs of cheese sauce, garlic sauce, marinara sauce Basic Cooking Rice Serving sizes: 1 person: 1 cup rice/1 cup water 2 persons: 2 cups rice/ 2 cups water You can find white rice, premium white rice and brown rice in instant versions. I prefer the premium white rice, and I prefer Minute Rice brand. Rice can handle sweet or savory flavors well. Rice should be put in a cozy for 5-10 minutes after you add boiling water. Couscous You can use either couscous in boxes or for a better buy, find it in bulk. Couscous is made from seminola, the same as pasta. It is pasta, it just doesn\\'t need anything but boiling water to cook. You can find it in regular, whole wheat or in flavored varieties. Basic cooking method: 1 person: 1/3 cup couscous to 1/2 cup water 2 persons: 3/4 cup couscous to 1 cup water To this you can add whatever flavorings, herbs or spices you might desire. A pinch of salt is usually mandatory with couscous. I always take salt packets with me to be sure. Couscous works well with either savory or sweet recipes- and handles items like nuts and dried fruit well. It does not do well though, with heavy thick sauces. Add your boiling water, stir well, and let sit for 5-10 minutes in a cozy. All Purpose Seasoning Mix 2 tsp garlic powder 1 tsp basil 1 tsp dillweed 1 tsp oregano 1 tsp powdered lemon rind Blend well Salt Free Creole Seasoning 2 1⁄2 Tbl paprika 2 Tbl garlic powder 1 Tbl black pepper 1 Tbl onion powder 1 Tbl cayenne pepper 1 Tbl dried oregano 1 Tbl dried thyme Blend well.

Serves 2. New Beef Stroganoff At home: Put sour cream powder and nutmeg in a small zip bag. Remaining ingredients go in a separate quart freezer bag. 3 Tablespoon powdered sour cream. If you don\\'t have sour cream powder on hand, a packet of cream cheese is a good substitute. 1 Pinch nutmeg 1/3 cup dehydrated ground beef 1/3 cup thinly sliced dried mushrooms 1 Tablespoon dried onion 1 1/3 Cups Chinese instant noodles (you can use ramen noodles also) To prepare, pour 2 cups boiling water into main bag. Stir and put in a cozy for 10 minutes. Drain off the broth-this makes a nice starter soup if you like. Add nutmeg and sour cream powder to the bag and any extra broth as needed and mix well. Serves1-2.

To prepare, add BBQ sauce, then boiling water to the quart freezer bag (not quite covering), knead gently and cozy 15 minutes. Divide and top with onions. Serves 2. Homemade Hamburger Helper These recipes can be dehydrated and taken with you for simple style meals, or one could simmer to prepare. To cut down on cooking time, one could use dried sliced potatoes (found in bulk sections), freeze-dried vegetables (sub 1/2 cup freeze- dried vegetables for 1 cup frozen) and precooked and dried pasts. Precooked pasta will cut back on cooking time by about half. Canned tomatoes can be pureed and dried at home. Servings would be in the 2-4 person range, per recipe made. This is a mix you can make in advance and use in a number of ways. Store tightly sealed. Use mix as a base for the following dinners: At home mix together: 2 cups nonfat dry milk 1 cup corn starch 1/4 cup beef bouillon powder 2 tablespoons onion flakes 1 teaspoon dried basil 1 teaspoon dried thyme 1 teaspoon black pepper 2 tablespoons dried parsley 1 tablespoon garlic powder Potato Beef Casserole 1 pound ground beef, browned and drained 3/4 cup water 6 potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced 1 cup frozen mixed veggies 1/2 cup dry mix To prepare, combine all and simmer, covered, until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Counties that border the Mississippi and the Wisconsin rivers are the most flood prone, but serious floods have occurred throughout the state. It is important to be prepared and know what to do before disaster strikes. BE PREPARED Find out if you live in a flood prone area. If you are new to the area, ask your local public works or emergency government office about local flood history. Ask whether your property is above or below the flood stage water level. If you live in a frequently flooded area, stockpile emergency building materials. These include plywood, plastic sheeting, lumber, nails, hammer, saw, pry bar, shovels and sandbags. Plan and practice an evacuation route. Contact your local emergency government office or local American Red Cross chapter for a copy of the community flood evacuation plan. This plan should include information on the safest routes to shelters. Individuals living in flash flood areas should have several alternate routes to higher ground. Have emergency supplies on hand. a) Flashlights and extra batteries b) Portable battery-operated radio and extra batteries c) First-aid kit and manual; essential medicines d) Emergency food, water, cooking equipment, can opener e) Cash and credit cards Develop an emergency communication plan. In case family members are separated during a disaster because of work or school, choose a long-distance relative or friend who can serve as the “family contact.” After a disaster, it is often easier to call long-distance than to place a local call. Make sure everyone in the family knows the name, address and phone number of the contact person. Make sure that all family members know how to respond after a flood or flash flood. Teach family members how to turn off gas, electricity and water; local authorities may request that you do so during a flood. Teach children how and when to call 911, police and fire, and which radio station to tune to for emergency information. Keep the car fueled. Stations may not be able to operate because of lack of electricity. Learn about the National Flood Insurance Program. Most Wisconsin communities participate in this program, which offers residents flood insurance. (See the fact sheet “Insurance Coverage and Making a Claim.”) Regular homeowner\\'s insurance does not cover flood damage. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension more information AFTER A FLOOD Don\\'t return home until authorities have indicated it is safe. When entering buildings, use extreme caution. Potential hazards include: Gas leaks. Leave your home immediately and call the gas company if you smell the putrid odor of leaking gas. Lanterns, torches, electrical sparks and cigarettes could cause an explosive fire if there is a leak. Do not turn on any light switches. Electrocution. Wear rubber gloves and rubber-soled shoes to avoid electrocution. Do not turn on any lights or appliances if the house has been flooded. Turn off the electricity when checking electrical circuits and equipment or when checking a flooded basement. Structural damage. Watch for falling debris and the possibility of collapsing ceilings and basement walls. Food and water. Do not use water or eat food that has come in contact with floodwaters.

DURING A FLOOD Listen to the radio for further information. Fill bathtubs, sinks and jugs with clean water in case water becomes contaminated. Bring outdoor belongings, such as patio furniture, indoors. Move valuable household possessions to the upper floors or to safe ground if time permits. If you are instructed by authorities, turn off all utilities at the main power switch and close the main gas valve. Join with neighbors and volunteers to put sandbags or other protection in place. Stack sandbags away from the outside walls of houses to prevent floodwaters from entering. Do not attempt to walk through moving floodwaters. If they are moving fast enough, water one foot deep can sweep you off your feet. Do not attempt to drive over a flooded road. Turn around and go another way. DURING AN EVACUATION Listen to the radio for evacuation instructions. If advised to evacuate, do so immediately. Evacuation is much simpler and safer before floodwaters become too deep for ordinary vehicles to drive through. Follow recommended evacuation routes — shortcuts may be blocked. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Wisconsin Division of Emergency Government University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Preparing to Evacuate Your Farm SAFETY MEASURES WHEN FLOODING IS EXPECTED If you live in an area prone to flooding or if flooding has been anticipated for some time, have an emergency plan for evacuation. It should include such considerations as family safety, equipment safety, livestock relocation and temporary milking facilities. When flooding is hours or minutes away, keep your priorities straight. Ensure family safety first. Be certain you have enough time to get to higher ground before access is cut off. If you have time before receiving an evacuation order, a number of precautions may help you protect your property and livestock. Additional resources: Weather-reporting services, such as the National Weather Service, to predict the severity of flooding; your county agricultural agent; your local emergency government office; the American Red Cross; the Federal Emergency Management Agency LONG-RANGE PREPARATION Take these precautions if flooding is common to your area or anticipated this season: Create an emergency plan of action, considering such things as areas of high ground for animal relocation, temporary milking facilities and approval to use them, equipment relocation and safe pesticide storage. Be sure cattle are properly immunized before being exposed to floodwaters. Arrange or be aware of standby services for emergency milk pick-up. Have a plan for moving grain out of reach of floodwaters. Provide riprap on banks of earthen manure storages where flowing water may erode berms. SHORT-TERM PREPARATION If time is available, take the following precautions: Move machinery, feed, grain, pesticides and herbicides to a higher elevation. If you have a two-story barn, the upper level makes a good temporary storage facility. Open gates so livestock can escape high water. If water is rising, try to drive stock through water free of obstructions. Grazing animals swim well, but the greatest problem for them are fences and other obstacles. Long swims through calm water are safer than short swims through a swift current. Leave building doors and windows open at least 2 inches to equalize pressure and help prevent buildings from shifting. If possible, move motors and portable electric equipment to a dry location. Disconnect electric power to all buildings which may be flooded. If in doubt about how to disconnect power, call your utility company. Tie down lumber, logs, irrigation pipes, fuel tanks and other loose equipment or material. Secondary containment is another possibility for fuel tanks, as well as pesticide storage. To keep surface water out of your well, use materials such as heavy plastic and duct tape to seal the well cap and top of the well casing. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension FLOOD-FARM PREPARATION Pesticide Storage Concerns During a Flood PREVENTION AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE Safe pesticide storage is of critical importance in both everyday and disaster situations. Not only can improperly stored pesticides pose significant hazards to humans, but they can do great harm to the environment, including surface water and groundwater contamination. Combined with floodwaters, pesticides can create a widespread health problem by threatening drinking supplies. For all of these reasons, take preventive measures to minimize storage quantities and potential exposure to floodwaters. Take extra precautions if you live in a floodplain or expect flooding. If flooding of pesticides occurs, be sure you follow safe, legal methods for emergency response, containment and clean-up. PREVENTION Choose a safe location. If at all possible, locate pesticides in an area where flooding is not likely. A good location will be downwind and downhill from sensitive areas, such as homes and play areas, ponds or streams. Update your pesticide storage design. Contact your local Extension agent or the Midwest Plan Service for modern pesticide storage plans. Safety is a major criterion in new designs, as well as efficiency for farmers. Features may include a mixing and loading pad, a drainage system to collect contaminated runoff, a worker safety area and a separate area for your personal protective clothing and equipment. Keep pesticide storage to a minimum. The fewer pesticides on site, the less you have to worry about. Consider the following: a) Contract to have pesticides applied. This eliminates storage and most liability concerns. b) Clean out existing inventories. If a pesticide is still registered for use, give it to a producer who can legally use it. If it is no longer registered, dispose of it at a county Agricultural Clean Sweep program. c) Purchase only enough pesticide for a single season. Take extra care with water-permeable containers. Dry formulations packed in paper bags, fiber drums, cardboard boxes or similar containers should be stored on metal shelves. Do not store liquid pesticides on shelves above dry formulations. If flooding is imminent, move pesticides (especially those in unsealed or water-permeable containers) to a higher storage location. Use caution in moving containers — wear protective gear as necessary. Develop an emergency response plan in case of a leak, spill or fire. Because of hazardous substances on you farm, you may be required to develop a plan under the Superfund Amendments Reauthorization Act (SARA) Title III. SARA requires farmers who have any of 360 extremely hazardous substances at 500 pounds or the threshold planning quantity to alert the State Emergency Response Board (SERB) with a Planning Notification Fee Statement. An off-site plan identifying the substances and their location on the farm must be developed with final plan copies sent to the local fire department, your Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and SERB. Contact the Wisconsin Division of Emergency Government for more information. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension FLOOD-FARM PREPARATION more information WATCH FOR PESTICIDE POISONING Be aware of any illness arising after handling pesticides or pesticide wastes. Acute symptoms of poisoning frequently include headache, nausea, diarrhea, visual disturbances, excessive salivation or sweating, difficulty in breathing, weakness, tremors or convulsions. Acute symptoms usually appear immediately or within a few hours after exposure. See a doctor immediately or contact your local poison control center if symptoms appear. Additional resources: Your local emergency government office, the Wisconsin Division of Emergency Government, your county agricultural agent Related publications: UW-Extension publication “Pest Management Principles for the Private Applicator.” “SARA Fact Sheet for Farmers,” available from the Wisconsin Division of Emergency Government. IF FLOODING HAS OCCURRED If you suspect flooding of pesticide storage areas, use great caution in investigating the immediate area — floodwaters may be contaminated with pesticides. Wear appropriate protective clothing, particularly safety boots, to avoid exposure. If a release of pesticides has occurred, you are required by the Wisconsin Spill Law to notify local and state authorities. Local authorities include your Local Emergency Planning Committee. You can meet state reporting requirements by calling the Wisconsin Division of Emergency Government Spill Hotline at (800) 943-0003. This hotline is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The duty officer at the Spill Hotline or your LEPC can help you determine if federal notification is needed. Emergency hotline personnel will gather information about the pesticide release and make response decisions. Emergency response professionals in your area will be notified to serve as the first responders to the flood site, as necessary. Some possible scenarios: For minimal flooding or leakage from paper containers, officials may provide you with specific clean-up instructions. For example, you may be asked to place the water-damaged pesticide into a secondary waste container and to dispose of it at the next Agricultural Clean Sweep event. If moderate flooding has occurred, containment and clean-up may be feasible. Area emergency response professionals may be sent to the site. Technical guidance from the DNR and the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection will be provided, as necessary. If major flooding has already occurred, containment may be impossible and clean-up minimal. Check your storage inventory to determine if product is missing. If so, inform your LEPC about types of pesticides and approximate amounts removed by floodwaters. CONTAIN THE AREA Take steps to prevent further release of the pesticides if possible and feasible. Put smaller containers that are leaking into larger containers. Wear protective clothing and equipment so you do not needlessly expose yourself to the material in the process of stopping the spill. At the same time the leak is being controlled, contain the spill material to the area; if possible, construct a dam to prevent the chemical from spreading. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Building Dikes to Prevent Flooding HOW TO FILL AND POSITION SANDBAGS Standing water from melting snow or heavy rains can flood basements and damage yards, wells, feed supplies, machinery and other property. Flooding is more apt to occur in areas with poor surface drainage, malfunctioning drainage systems or ice dams. A 1- to 3-foot-high sandbag or earth dike offers protection from shallow flooding (water depth less than 3 feet). Contact a construction firm, lumberyard or your county emergency government office for information on where to obtain sandbags. SITE SELECTION Select the site for the dike, making the best use of natural land features to keep it as short and low as possible. Avoid trees or other obstructions which would weaken the structure. Do not build the dike against a basement wall. Leave about 8 feet of space to maneuver between the dike and buildings. Remove ice and snow, down to the bare ground if possible, from the strip of land you\\'ve selected. SANDBAG NEEDS The number of bags required for 100 linear feet of dike is as follows: 800 bags for 1-foot-high dike 2,000 bags for 2-foot-high dike 3,400 bags for 3- foot-high dike FILLING AND POSITIONING SANDBAGS See diagrams on the back side. If you are building the dike on a lawn you may omit the bonding trench shown in the diagram on Stacking Sandbags. Fill bags approximately half full of clay, silt or sand. Do not tie. Alternate direction of bags with bottom layer lengthwise of dike. Lap unfilled portion under next bag. Tamp thoroughly in place. Build the dike three times as wide as high. For example, if the height is 3 feet, make the base 9 feet. SEALING THE DIKE Seal the finished dike to increase its watertightness. To seal the dike: Spread a layer of earth or sand 1 inch deep and about 1 foot wide along the bottom of the dike on the water side. Lay polyethylene plastic sheeting so the bottom edge extends 1 foot beyond the bottom edge of the dike over the loose dirt. The upper edge should extend over the top of the dike. This sheeting is available from construction supply firms, lumberyards and farm stores. It should be about 6 mils thick. It comes in 100-foot rolls and is 8 or 10 feet wide. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension FLOOD-FARM PREPARATION more information Additional resources: Your local emergency government office, your county agricultural agent, the American Red Cross, the Federal Emergency Management Agency Lay the plastic sheeting down very loosely. The pressure of the water will then make the plastic conform easily with the sandbag surface. If the plastic is stretched too tightly, the water force could puncture it. Place a row of tightly fitting sandbags on the bottom edge of the plastic to form a watertight seal along the water side. Place sandbags at about 6 foot intervals to hold down the top edge of the plastic. Place boards or dirt between these sandbags to prevent winds from disturbing the plastic. As you work, avoid puncturing the plastic with sharp objects or by walking on it. HOW TO FILL AND LAP SANDBAGS STACKING SANDBAGS SEALING THE DIKE Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Protecting Livestock During a Flood GUIDELINES FOR SAFE SHELTER AND EVACUATION Unconfined livestock can usually take care of themselves during floods. Do not let them become trapped in low-lying pens. A number of safety precautions, as outlined at right, can be taken for animals housed in barns during a flood. Above all, be sure animals are evacuated before floodwaters enter barns and other enclosed livestock areas. Animals sometimes refuse to leave during a rapid rise of water and may drown. Additional resources: Weather-reporting services, such as the National Weather Service, to predict the severity of flooding; your local emergency government office; your county agricultural agent KEEPING LIVESTOCK HIGH AND DRY In broad, level flood plains where floodwaters are seldom deeper than 3 or 4 feet, you may need to construct mounds of soil on which livestock can stay until floodwaters recede. Try to locate the mounds where they will not be washed away by fast-flowing water. THINK ESSENTIALS, SAFETY IN BARNS Provide feed and water. Water is essential. Thirsty animals will try to break out to get to floodwaters. If clean water is in short supply, limit feed intake. If animals are housed with machinery, fasten bales of straw in front of sharp edges and protruding parts such as cutter bars or crank handles. (Do not use hay, because animals will eat it.) Try to cover wooden paddle wheels on combines or choppers, since these parts can be dangerous. Block off narrow passageways where animals would be unable to turn around. A few heavy animals in a narrow dead end can be dangerous both to themselves and the building. Be absolutely certain that herbicides, pesticides and treated seeds are not even remotely accessible to livestock, and are stored where floodwater will not contaminate livestock feed or water. Turn off electricity at the main switch. Livestock could damage electric fixtures, causing fires or electrocutions. If there is a possibility that dairy barns may become inundated, drive cattle out of the barn. During rapid rise of water, cattle often refuse to leave the barn and may drown inside if the water rises high enough. For this reason, begin evacuation measures before a state of emergency. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Standby Electric Generators A SOURCE OF EMERGENCY POWER FOR FARMERS An emergency source of power is important for any farm with mechanically ventilated production facilities, bulk milk handling equipment, mechanical feeding equipment or facilities requiring constant and continuous heat (such as brooders). On such a farm, a standby electric generator is a good investment, possibly preventing costly losses during a power failure. During disasters such as flood or tornado, relief agencies may provide generators to farmers on an emergency basis. TYPES OF GENERATORS Standby generators are either engine driven or tractor driven. Either type can be stationary or portable. Engine driven units can be either manual or automatic start. Gasoline-, LP gas- (bottled gas) and diesel-fueled engines are available. Generators must provide the same type of power at the same voltage and frequency as that supplied by power lines. This is usually 120/240 volt, single phase, 60 cycle alternating current (AC). An air-cooled engine is often used for generators up to 15 kilowatts. A liquid-cooled engine is necessary for generators larger than 15 kilowatts. Engine capacity of 2 to 2 1/4 hp with the proper drive system must be available for each 1,000 watts of generator output. SIZE OF GENERATORS A full-load system will handle the entire farmstead load. Automatic engine-powered, full-load systems will begin to furnish power immediately, or up to 30 seconds after power is off. Smaller and less expensive part-load systems may be enough to handle essential equipment during an emergency. Power-take-off (PTO) generators are about half as costly as engine-operated units. Under a part-load system, only the most essential equipment is operated at one time. For most farms, this type of system is adequate, provided the generator is sized to start the largest motor. For example, the milk cooler or ventilation fan would need to be operated continuously, but the operation of the silo unloader and mechanical feeding system could be postponed until the milking chores are completed. PTO units can be mounted on a trailer. INSTALLATION Wiring and equipment must be installed in accordance with the National Electrical Code, local ordinances and the requirements of your power supplier. It is essential that you have the proper equipment for disconnecting the generator from public utility lines. Most companies require the installation of a double-pole double-throw transfer switch or its equivalent for this purpose. Check with your electrician or power supply representative for installation, installation instructions and inspection. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension FLOOD-FARM PREPARATION more information Additional resources: Your county agricultural agent Related publications: UW-Extension publications– “Standby Electric Power Equipment for the Farm and Home,” (AF2273); “Electrical Systems for Agricultural Buildings,” (checklist), (A8NE846); “Electrical Systems for Agricultural Buildings,” (recommended practices), (A8NE845). “Standby Power,” Illinois Farm Electrification Council, Fact Sheet 2. LOCATION AND SAFETY FEATURES Large engine generators should be located in a building, preferably a heated building. Inlet and outlet air ducts must be large enough to carry off excess heat. They should be open at least a half a square foot for each 1,000 watts of generator capacity. Combustion fumes must be carried outdoors safely. Exhaust pipes must be at least 6 inches from combustible material. OPERATION An automatic standby unit should start automatically when power fails, and stop when power is restored. When using an engine-driven generator with a manual start, or when using a tractor driven unit, follow this procedure when power fails: Call your power supplier and advise them of the conditions. Turn off or disconnect all electrical equipment. Position the tractor or engine for belt of PTO drive. Start the unit and bring the generator up to proper speed (1,800 or 3,600 rps). Check on arrangement to carry off exhaust fumes. Be sure there is no danger of fire. The voltmeter will indicate when the generator is ready to carry the load. Put the transfer switch in the generator position. Start the largest electrical motor first, adding other loads when each is up to operating speed. Do not add too much too fast. If the generator cuts out for any reason, repeat the second, third and fourth steps above. Check the voltmeter frequently. If voltage falls below 200 volts for 240 volt service or below 100 volts for 120 volt service, reduce the load on the generator by turning off some electrical equipment. When commercial power is restored, put the transfer switch in normal power position. Then stop the standby unit. MAINTENANCE Keep the unit clean and in good running order at all times so it will be ready for immediate use. Dust and dirt accumulations on the motor can cause it to overheat when operated. Follow maintenance instructions in manufacturer\\'s manual. A short operation at set intervals will keep the engine in good operating condition. Regularly scheduled warm-ups are necessary to keep a standby engine in working order. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Avoiding Groundwater Damage to Homes REMEDIES FOR HOMEOWNERS Groundwater flooding can cause many problems for homeowners. Structural damage, sewer system back-ups and damaged appliances are three of the most distressing consequences. Fortunately, there are some remedies. They vary in scope, expense and results, just as homeowners vary in their expectations and resources. CONSIDER YOUR RESOURCES Sound advice should be your first priority when groundwater flooding is a problem. Expertise can come from a variety of sources. ® Local resources include your local emergency government office, building inspectors, insurance agents (if you have appropriate insurance), county Extension agents and the Home Builders Association. All have access to technical assistance, publications and possible sources of financial aid. ® Financial assistance may be available through your local emergency government office. This may also include temporary housing and crisis counseling. a) Grants and low-interest loans may be available in cases of regional disasters. b) Check with your insurance agent to determine whether your homeowner\\'s insurance covers any of the damages. Groundwater, surface water and floodwater damages usually are not covered by homeowner\\'s insurance. Your agent may have a rider available for groundwater flooding. Homes located in floodplains subject to surface water flooding are eligible for federal flood insurance. ® Contractors can help you determine the nature and extent of your damages and what remediation options are appropriate for your situation. a) A waterproofing contractor may be able to correct the problem if you simply need to stop minor nuisance flooding. b) A general contractor may be necessary if you have damages to your home and need more substantial repairs and corrective measures. General contractors can arrange for the services of various specialists. (See the fact sheet, \"Hiring a Contractor After a Disaster,\" for more information.) YOUR OPTIONS The severity and frequency of groundwater flooding will in part dictate the best solution. The following options parallel increasing severity of groundwater flooding: ® Raising appliances, furniture and fixtures. In cases where groundwater flooding is a minor nuisance that amounts to little more than wet walls and small streams across the basement floor to a drain, solutions may include: University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension FLOOD-CLEAN-UP/REPAIR more information Additional resources: Your county Extension office, your local emergency government office, building inspectors, insurance agents (if you have appropriate insurance), the Home Builders Association, the Federal Emergency Management Agency Related publications: UW-Extension publications– “Removing Ground Water From a Basement of an Existing Home,” December 1993; “Hiring a Contractor After a Natural Disaster,” December 1993. “Repairing Your Flooded Home,” the American Red Cross/Federal Emergency Management Agency, 1992. “Retrofitting Flood-Prone Residential Structures,” Federal Emergency Management Agency, 1986. a) Raising or blocking up appliances, furniture and other items that may be damaged by direct contact with the water for an extended time; b) Installing a false floor over the basement slab. This allows water to drain under the false floor to a drain or sump. c) Installing a surface drainage system around the perimeter of the basement floor. This method channels water from the walls to a drain or sump for removal. Relieving water pressure against walls and the floor. Some form of drainage is necessary when cracks occur because of water pressure. a) If the basement or foundation does not already have drain tile installed, consider an excavation of the home exterior to allow for waterproofing of the walls and the installation of washed stone (gravel) and drain tile. Drain tile can divert water away from the house if there is a slope, or accommodate a sump pump system as noted below. b) Internal drainage is another option if excavation is not possible or convenient. Washed stone and drain tile are installed around the interior perimeter of the basement footing. This requires subfloor installation and trenching. c) Sump pumps are a necessary part of the internal drainage system unless the interior tile can be connected to exterior tile that will drain away from the house. Similarly, sump pumps may be a necessary part of external drain tile systems if water does not drain away from the house naturally. Filling the basement. This option can eliminate the groundwater problem, but the trade-off is the loss of a full basement. If the groundwater level in a basement is only 1 or 2 feet, one option is to pour a new floor in at a higher level, leaving a crawl space in the basement. The original floor needs to be broken first, so that water pressure can be relieved. Fill dirt is brought in and the new floor poured. Drainage under the new floor also is recommended. In more severe cases, the basement may have to be completely abandoned. Rebuilding septic systems and wells. If septic systems and wells have been compromised, the systems should be rebuilt following modern guidelines for high groundwater areas. There may be added expenses related to closing or removing portions of existing systems that have failed. Raising or relocating the house. This is the most expensive option. It is the best long-term solution when the building integrity is threatened and utilities must be shut off. In some cases, it may be the only reason-able option to avoid property damages and lower property values. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Before you enter a flooded basement, take time to: 1) Turn off the electricity, preferably at the meter; 2) Check outside cellar walls for possible cave-ins, evidence of structural damage or other hazards; 3) Turn off gas or fuel service valves; and 4) Open doors and windows or use blowers to force fresh air into the basement. PUMPING For safety reasons, do not use an electric pump powered by your own electrical system. Instead, use a gas-powered pump or one connected to an outside line. Fire departments in some communities may help with pumping services. More damage may be done by pumping flooded basements too soon or too quickly. Water in the basement helps brace the walls against the extra pressure of water-logged soil outside. If water is pumped out too soon, walls may be pushed in or floors pushed up. To help prevent this kind of structural damage: ® Remove about a third of the water each day. Watch for signs of structural failing. ® If the outside water level rises again after the day\\'s pumping, start at the new water line. ® Don\\'t rush the pumping; the soil may be very slow to drain. Whatever is submerged in the basement will not be damaged further by delaying the pumping. CLEANING After water has been pumped from the basement, shovel out the mud and debris while it is still moist. Hose down walls to remove as much silt as possible before it dries. Floors and walls may need sanitizing, particularly if sewage has entered the basement. Scrub walls and floors with a disinfecting solution of 1 cup chlorine bleach per gallon of water. Oil stains caused by overturned or damaged oil tanks also may be a problem following basement flooding. Commercial products, available from fuel-oil suppliers, will help neutralize fuel oil. The products come in powder form or an aerosol spray for hard-to-reach places. To remove oil stains and destroy odor: wipe up excess oil, shake or spray product on the spot according to manufacturer\\'s directions, let it set, then sweep it up. INSPECTION AND REPAIR Before beginning repairs, make a thorough inspection of supporting columns, beams, walls and floors. Unless you have structural expertise, hire a contractor to make a professional survey. (Consider joining with neighbors for a group-rate inspection.) Repairs may extend to the following: University of Wisconsin-Extension CooperativeExtension FLOOD-CLEAN-UP/REPAIR more information Cleaning and Repairing Flooded Basements GETTING OUT WATER AND PREVENTING FUTURE PROBLEMS Additional resources: Your county family living agent, your local emergency government office, the American Red Cross, the Federal Emergency Management Agency Related publications: \"Repairing Your Flooded Home,\" the American Red Cross/Federal Emergency Buckled walls. Signs of buckling include horizontal cracking and areas that have moved out of vertical alignment. When this condition is minor, you need not repair the wall immediately. However, any noticeably buckled wall will eventually collapse from normal ground pressures and seasonal temperature changes. When buckling has seriously weakened the wall, the damaged parts should be rebuilt immediately. Pilasters (vertical reinforcements) may need to be constructed into walls over 15 feet long. Settled walls and footings are indicated by vertical cracks either in small areas or throughout the structure. Repairs are difficult without special equipment. Contact a reliable contractor for this work. Heaved floors are those that have not returned to their original level or have cracked badly. The floor may have to be removed and a new floor constructed. If a floor is badly cracked, but has returned to its original level, a new floor may be placed over the old one. A vapor barrier should be added between the two floors. The new floor should be at least 2 inches thick. In houses without basements, the area below the floor may be completely filled with mud. Shovel out the mud as soon as possible to avoid rotting joists or foundation wood. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service, University of Missouri Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Home Clean-Up and Sanitation SAFELY CLEANING A FLOOD-DAMAGED HOME Clean-up priorities will vary depending upon the kind and seriousness of damage to your home. But assuming major concerns such as structural safety, basement flooding, and electrical and water systems have been addressed, clean-up can begin inside. Start cleaning your furnishings as soon as possible. Your aim should be to thoroughly dry and clean the house before trying to live in it or have permanent repairs made. Early efforts should include taking furniture, rugs, bedding and clothing outside to dry and prevent mildew. SET PRIORITIES AND KEEP SAFETY IN MIND As you begin clean-up, focus on accomplishing the most important tasks first. Resist over-exerting yourself. Give special attention to cleaning children\\'s toys, cribs, playpens and play equipment. Boil any items a toddler or baby might put in his or her mouth. Discard stuffed toys, water-logged toys and non-cleanable items. Keep chemicals used for disinfecting and poisons used for insect and rodent control out of children\\'s reach. Wear protective clothing on legs, arms, feet and hands while cleaning up debris. GENERAL RULES FOR CLEANING AND DISINFECTING Wash exposed skin frequently in purified water. Wear rubber gloves to protect against contamination and skin irritation. Try using a pump-up garden sprayer or hose to remove layers of mud from hard surfaces. Scrub with a household cleaner/detergent solution and a brush to remove remaining surface oil. Rinse with clean water. Wash with a disinfectant, such as chlorine bleach, pine oil or a phenolic product, such as Lysol. Remember, a product is considered to be a “disinfectant” only if it is labeled as such. Rinse well. Dry items thoroughly to prevent mildew growth. Sanitize dishes, cooking utensils and food preparation areas before using them (see fact sheet, “Disinfecting Dishes, Cookware and Utensils”). REMOVING MOLD AND MILDEW Brush off mold and mildew growth on household items outdoors to prevent scattering of spores in the house. Vacuum floors, ceilings and walls to remove mildew. Then wash surfaces with a detergent/household cleaner and water solution.

Wipe mildew-stained areas with a cloth dampened with a solution of 1 cup of chlorine bleach or rubbing or denatured alcohol to 1 gallon water. Pine-based or phenolic products also work well. PREVENTING MILDEW GROWTH Use an air conditioner, dehumidifier or heater, if available, to remove moisture. Use fans to circulate air and open all windows. Turn on electric lights in closets and leave doors open to dry the dampness and humidity. Spray with a fungicide or other mildew preventive product. Read and follow instructions and precautions on product label. Dry thoroughly. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Illinois Cooperative Extension Service, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Electrical Systems and Appliances GENERAL CLEAN-UP AND WHAT TO DO BEFORE THE ELECTRICIAN ARRIVES Restoring the electrical system and evaluating damage to appliances are high priorities after a flood. But before your electrical system is turned on, it should be thoroughly checked for short circuits by an electrician or other competent person. Ask your power supplier for advice and assistance. Before entering your home after the flood, be sure that the electricity has been completely shut off. Appliances should not be operated until they have been thoroughly cleaned and reconditioned. Running equipment before it is properly cleaned could seriously damage it and may cause electrical shock. ELECTRICAL CIRCUITS AND EQUIPMENT Things to do before the electrician arrives: Have electricity shut off at both the meter and in the buildings. When touching switches, stand on a dry board and use a dry stick or rubber gloves to pull handles. Remove covers from all switches, convenience outlets, light outlets and junction boxes that have been under water. If a box is filled with mud, remove the screws that hold the receptacle or the switch in place. Pull receptacle, switch and wires out about two inches from box. Clean out all mud and dirt. Do not remove electrical connections. Leave boxes open for electrician. Remove all fuses and covers from entrance panel. Clean out all mud. Wires can be moved, but do not disconnect. For some equipment, such as pumps, a temporary line can be installed by an electrician until the permanent wiring has a chance to dry. ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES Here are some general rules to follow: Television sets and radios. Professional cleaning is recommended for these types of appliances. There is a danger of shock because certain internal parts can store electricity even when the appliance is unplugged. Check the back for a warning label. Get a cost estimate before repairs to see if the appliance is worth saving. Motorized appliances. These include the washing machine, dryer, dishwasher and vacuum cleaner. Professional cleaning of the motor and other parts is recommended. However, you can clean the exterior surfaces in the meantime. a) Use a heavy-duty cleaner and hot water to remove stains and silt deposits. Follow up with a rinse solution of 2 tablespoons chlorine bleach to each quart of water. b) When removing gritty deposits, rinse your cloth in water frequently to avoid scratching enamel or metal surfaces. c) Clean and disinfect dishwashers, washing machines and dryers only with water that has been declared safe to drink.

Refrigerators, freezers and ovens. These appliances may have foam insulation and sealed components that suffer little water damage. But since they hold food, they should be cleaned, disinfected and checked by a professional or replaced. If replacement is recommended, get the opinion in writing and discuss it with your insurance adjuster before money is spent for a new appliance. Heating appliances. Disconnect hot water heaters and remove all panels and any flood-soaked insulation. Have an electrician or professional repair person clean and restore the unit to working order. Lights and lamps. Remove fixtures that were submerged. Clean outlet boxes, sockets and wiring. Floor or table lamps should be completely disassembled and cleaned. Damaged cords and plugs should be replaced. Consider taking lamps to an appliance shop unless you are familiar with these repairs. GROUNDING All metallic appliances that have been flooded should be properly grounded to prevent electric shock. Mud or dirt in a grounded outlet or adapter may prevent the grounding system from working, and you could be electrocuted. If you are unsure if your electrical system is properly grounded, call an electrician. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Florida Cooperative Extension Service, Iowa State University Extension, American Red Cross/Federal Emergency Management Agency University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Restoring Heating Systems After a Flood ASSESSING DAMAGE AND GENERAL CLEAN-UP Any heating system exposed to flooding should be professionally inspected, cleaned and reconditioned before reuse. Floodwater may have damaged heating equipment and undermined chimneys. If chimney cracks or leaks go unrepaired, your family is at risk of fire or carbon-monoxide poisoning. Ask the service person if there is anything you can do to help before his or her arrival. Usually this will include turning off fuel and power to flooded units as a safety measure, and removing mud and debris from the furnace housing and inside the chimney. Leave things like inspection of oil storage tanks and cleaning of motors, blowers and other flooded parts to the professional. Flood insurance and federal disaster assistance programs usually will help replace flooded gas and oil appliances, including furnaces. OIL AND GAS SYSTEMS In general, any flooded parts should be professionally inspected and cleaned before turning the system back on. Check your owner\\'s manual if you are unfamiliar with the system. If your furnace was flooded to the level of the burners, turn off the valve on the pipe leading to it. If burners were hot when flooded, parts may have cracked. Modern furnaces also have an electrical switch for blowers. Turn this off as well if any furnace parts were flooded. OIL-BURNING SYSTEMS Have the storage tank inspected by an experienced person to make sure water and dirt have not entered. Have the electric motor, burners, blowers, fuel pump and gears cleaned and reconditioned by an expert. Flooded fuel filters should be replaced. Be certain that the fan motor, electric ignition systems and wiring are completely clean and dry before you turn on the electricity. If you have a hot water system, clean the fins on baseboard radiators. Clean any wall radiators. LIQUID PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS SYSTEMS Some natural gas systems may have a valve to the pilot gas line, in addition to the main fuel valve. Turn both off if this is the case. Have a service person: a) Check to see if water leaked into the controls or pressure regulator. b) Clean and recondition all flooded equipment, including burner elements, electric controls and regulators. c) Replace severely flooded electric blower motors. If you smell natural gas — which has a distinctive, putrid odor — leave your home and contact your utility company or a service person. Do not use open flames in the area.

Pamphlets on heating systems from your local utility company. ELECTRIC SYSTEM Electric heating systems are part of electrical wiring system clean-up. Many local codes require that a licensed electrician do the work, or that a municipal inspector check the system before you turn the power back on. If power isn\\'t shut off to a flooded furnace system, shut the main switch off at the meter or remove the fuse to the furnace. (When touching switches, stand on a dry board and use rubber gloves or a dry stick to pull handles.) Clean mud and debris from electric baseboard heating fixtures, being careful not to damage heating equipment. Have a professional handle cleaning and reconditioning of all working parts. CHIMNEYS A cracked, clogged or leaky chimney can cause fires or carbon monoxide poisoning. Be sure you check your chimney for dirt, debris and leaks before lighting the furnace or a fire. If flood damage has occurred, have a mason do an inspection and make repairs. Most chimneys have a foundation in the ground. If the chimney looks like it has settled or tilted, examine the footing to see whether it has been undermined. Have the chimney rebuilt if it has settled badly or is broken where it passes through floors or roof. If mortar in the joints between bricks has disintegrated, have a mason rejoint the chimney with cement. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, the American Red Cross, the Federal Emergency Management Agency University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Flood-Damaged Walls, Ceilings and Floors REMOVING MOISTURE, CLEANING AND REPAIRING Be prepared to let flood-damaged walls, ceilings and floors dry for several weeks. If restoration work is completed before proper drying, mold and mildew will continue to grow. The result may be structural damage to your home, the need to repaint walls or replace new wall coverings, and discomfort or illness to family members who have allergies. GETTING THE MOISTURE OUT Remove all water as soon as possible from your home. Also remove furnishings that are water soaked. Once water is removed, the next step is removing moisture that has been absorbed by wood, plaster and other materials. If the weather permits, open doors and windows to remove moisture and odors. If the outside humidity becomes greater than inside, close things up; likewise, close up the house overnight if temperatures drop and moist air might otherwise be drawn indoors. If windows are stuck tight, take off window strips and remove entire sash. If doors are stuck, drive out door hinge pins with a screwdriver and hammer, then remove. Consider using dehumidifiers to speed up drying when outside humidity levels are high. If possible, rent commercial dehumidifiers, which remove three to four times more water than home models. When using dehumidifiers, shut windows and doors. If there is severe flooding in your home, consider hiring a contractor for water removal. Some companies can dry homes in less than a week with commercial dehumidifiers and air movers. WALLS and CEILINGS Wash out mud, dirt and debris as soon as possible with a hose and mop cloth or sponge. Start cleaning from the top floor or upper limit of flooding and work downward. Remove wallboard, plaster and paneling to at least the flood level. Wallboard acts like a sponge when wet. If soaked by contaminated floodwater, it can be a permanent health hazard and should be removed. If most of the wallboard was soaked by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This creates a “chimney effect” of air movement for faster drying. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well, but use only the tip of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and wiring. Plaster usually does not need to be replaced, though it will take a very long time to dry. Some paneling may be salvaged if allowed to dry slowly. You also should remove and dispose of any flood-damaged insulation, which will hold water for months after getting wet. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension FLOOD-CLEAN-UP/REPAIR more information REMOVING MILDEW To remove surface mildew on walls or ceilings, use a mildew surface cleaner (available at paint stores) or: scrub the mildew with household detergent, then scrub with a solution of one-quarter cup bleach to 1 quart water. Rinse well with clean water. Once fully dry, apply a coat of paint containing an anti-mildew agent. To remove surface mildew on floors and woodwork, use a phosphate cleaning solution such as powdered automatic dishwashing detergent or trisodium phosphate (4 to 6 tablespoons to a gallon of water), available in hardware stores. Rinse with water, and when dry, apply a mildew-resistant finish. Additional resources: Your county family living agent, your local emergency government office, the American Red Cross, the Federal Emergency Management Agency Related publications: “Repairing Your Flooded Home,” American Red Cross/Federal Emergency Management Agency, 1992. UW-Extension Publications– “Removing Water From the Building Materials of a Water Damaged Home;” “High Humidity After Water Damage and the Growth of Mildew and Mites.” To clean surfaces: Thoroughly wash and disinfect walls, ceilings, exposed wall cavities and studs. Use a good disinfectant to prevent mildew build-up. One cup of chlorine bleach mixed with a gallon of water works well. For a soapier cleaning solution, add a half cup of mild detergent. Wear rubber gloves. If walls have already dried, work from the floor to the ceiling to prevent streaking. (Dirty water splashed on dry walls may be absorbed and become almost impossible to remove.) Overlap sections, cleaning the ceiling last. FLOORS Before the house has dried out, scrub floors and woodwork with a stiff brush, plenty of water, a detergent and disinfectant. Carpeting soaked by contaminated floodwater should be removed and discarded unless it can be sanitized at a commercial facility for a cost substantially less than replacement. Vinyl flooring and floor tile may need to be removed to allow drying of subfloor. Wooden floors should be dried gradually. Sudden drying could cause cracking or splitting. Some restoration companies can accelerate drying time by forcing air through the fluted underside of hardwood floorboards. ONCE FLOORS HAVE DRIED Assess whether your floors can be repaired, replaced or recovered. Consider your time and budget as you make any decisions. If hardwood floors are damaged beyond repair, you may want to forego the cost of replacement and instead cover them with carpeting, vinyl or linoleum. Or you might lay a new floor over the old, rather than replace it. Plywood subfloors may have delaminated (separated) from excessive moisture, causing buckling. Sections may have to be replaced or have new plywood nailed over them. Consult a contractor for this work. If buckling or warping has occurred, drive nails where the floor tends to lift or bulge. This will prevent further damage. Badly warped hardwood floors usually can\\'t be repaired. Warped, wide pine board flooring, however, will often flatten out after it has thoroughly dried. Plane or sand floors level. Do not refinish until thoroughly dry. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service, University of Missouri Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Drying and Repairing Walls REMEDIES FOR INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR SURFACES Walls must be dry from the inside out before restoration, repainting or recovering can begin. Even when walls feel dry to the touch, the material inside the wall may be wet. Drying the inside of the walls may take weeks or even months. The total drying time will depend partially on the amount of dry air that can circulate through the studding and different wall materials. Plaster and paneling can often be saved, but you still need to get air circulating in the wall cavities to dry the studs and sills. Wallboard soaked by dirty floodwater will need to be replaced. If the wallboard was damaged by clean rainwater, consider cutting a 4- to 12-inch-high section from the bottom and top of walls. This will create a “chimney effect” to speed up drying time. A reciprocating saw with a metal cutting blade works well for this task, but use only the tip of the blade and watch out for pipes, ductwork and wiring. GUIDELINES FOR WALL COVERINGS AND INSULATION Remove drywall, laminated paneling and plaster at least to the flood level. Warping above the water level often occurs with drywall and paneling, so more may need to be removed. Plaster walls can sometimes be adequately drained by removing the baseboard and breaking out plaster and lath at the bottom of the wall. Later the baseboard can cover the opening. Some paneling may be salvaged if allowed to dry slowly. Remove the baseboard from paneled walls and pry off the individual sheets. Prop them against the wall to dry. Don\\'t allow them to dry in sunlight, which may cause warping. Remove vinyl-covered wallpaper. It will restrict drying within flood-damaged walls. Water-soaked insulation should be removed and replaced. It can hold water for months, causing odor and decay problems. While wet it has little insulation value. Consider wainscoting as a restoration option if flooding is no higher than 3 feet above the floor. PATCHING PLASTER Do not attempt to repair plaster until walls and inner walls (studding and insulation) are completely dry. If walls were flooded extensively, you may need to wait four to six weeks, or even several months, before attempting repairs. Drywall compound is the preferred method for patching plaster. It comes in a variety of types with different drying times, shrinkage characteristics and consistencies. Read labels to select the type you need. REPAIRING EXTERIOR SIDING Dry wall cavities from the inside if possible. (See previous section.) Remove small section of siding to check conditions on the reverse side. If crevasses are filled with silt, remove siding to water level and clean. Silt left in crevasses will trap moisture, causing mold, decay and peeling paint. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension FLOOD-CLEAN-UP/REPAIR more information Additional resources: Your county family living agent, your local emergency government office, the American Red Cross, the Federal Emergency Management Agency Related publications: “Removing Water From the Building Materials of a Water-Damaged Home,” University of Wisconsin-Extension, Madison, 1994. “Repairing Your Flooded Home,” American Red Cross/Federal Emergency Management Agency, 1992. TIPS on Repairing or Rebuilding Your Disaster-Damaged Home, FEMA, 1981. Check for cracked or warped siding. If only a few boards are warped or cracked, replace them individually. CHECKING SHEATHING Sheathing is the material between studding and finish siding. Depending upon the type of sheathing, replacement may or may not be necessary. Wooden boards should dry slowly and some will warp. Re-nail warped areas after they dry. Replace those that are too badly warped to salvage. Sheathing board is usually absorbent and difficult to dry. Replace any that is disintegrating or separating. Plywood will probably separate and must be replaced. Marine plywood will not warp or separate, but is generally considered too expensive to use in residential construction unless the building is subject to frequent flooding.

First, try binoculars for a closer view. Next, check the attic for a drip trail. Leaks are rarely located directly above the water spot on the ceiling. When you find a leak in the attic, push a nail, straw or wire through it to help you or a repair person locate it outside. If rain continues to be a problem and a repair person is unavailable, follow the directions at right for temporary relief. But be sure that only a physically able person gets on the roof for these emergency measures. Unsteadiness on the ladder or roof can lead to severe injuries. Additional resources: Your county family living agent, your local emergency government office, the American Red Cross, the Federal Emergency Management Agency Related publications: \"Repairing Your Flooded Home,\" American Red Cross/Federal Emergency Management Agency, 1992. TEMPORARY REPAIRS Cover holes in the roof, walls or windows with boards, tarps or plastic sheeting. Nail down plastic sheets or trash bags with strips of wood and secure them with duct tape. If the holes are large, you may need to support the plastic in the center to keep it from ripping from the weight of the rain. If sections of the roof or floors are sagging, have a contractor or other knowledgeable person brace weak areas. Improper bracing may increase damage and the chance of injury, so do not attempt this work unless you are experienced in structural repairs. CAUSES OF LEAKS Storm and wind damage are responsible for some roof problems. Others are caused by defective materials, faulty construction or gradual deterioration. Here are some common causes of leaks: Defective flashing. Flashing is the sheet metal used in waterproofing roof valleys, hips and the angle between a chimney and a roof. Wet spots near a chimney or outside wall may mean the leak is caused by defective flashing, narrow flashing or loose mortar joints. Look for corroded, loose or displaced flashing on sloping roof valleys and at junctions of dormers and roof. Clogged downspouts or eaves. Check for choked downspouts. Accumulated water or snow on the roof above the flashing may cause a leak. Ice accumulations on eaves sometimes form ridges, which cause melting snow to back up under the shingles. Cracks and deterioration. Roofing (especially wood or composition shingles) usually deteriorates first on southern exposures. Check southern slopes for cracking or deterioration. Holes. Missing shingles or holes in the roofing may be causing wet spots. To find holes, check for a drip trail or spot of light coming through in the attic. Stick a nail, straw or wire through the hole to mark the spot on the outside. REPAIRING LEAKS Methods of repair will depend on the kind of roofing and the nature and extent of the leak. Unless you are experienced, hire a professional roofer for this work. Missing shingles should be replaced, holes repaired and cracks filled. Whatever method is used, avoid walking on patched sections. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service, University of Minnesota Extension Service, University of Missouri Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Cleaning Flood-Soiled Clothing and Bedding WHAT TO SALVAGE AND HOW TO CLEAN IT Unfortunately, cleaning your flood-soiled clothing and bedding is not the same as doing the usual family wash. Items need to be sanitized as you wash them. And your washing machine may be flood-damaged, making machine washing out of the question until you can get to a laundromat or friend\\'s house. Nevertheless, you can help prevent mildew damage to clothes and bedding by sorting and drying items as soon as possible. Even if your washing machine was not flooded, avoid using it until you know that the water is safe enough to drink and that your sewer line works. Before you wash clothes in the machine, run it through one full cycle. Be sure to use hot water and a disinfectant or sanitizer, such as chlorine bleach. CLOTHING When cleaning flood-damaged clothing: Separate wet items as soon as possible to keep clothing colors from running together. Sort out clothing that should be drycleaned. Take clothes and linens outdoors and shake out dried mud or dirt. Hose off extremely muddy items to avoid clogging your drain when you wash. If you don\\'t have access to water, simply dry things out. If possible, soak badly soiled items overnight in cold water and detergent. Wring out and air dry if you\\'re unable to machine wash right away. Check the labels on clothes and linens, and wash them in detergent and warm water if possible. Adding chlorine bleach to the wash cycle will remove most mildew and will sanitize the clothing. Because bleach fades some fabrics and damages others, use other sanitizers, such as pine oil cleaners, as necessary. If an item is still stained after washing, rewash before drying. Drying may make some stains more difficult to remove. Items to be drycleaned should be air-dried and taken to a cleaner as soon as possible. Furs and leathers are usually worth the cost of professional cleaning. If you want to clean leather yourself, wash the mud off and dry the leather slowly. Keep it away from heat or sunlight while drying. BEDDING Bedding should be hung out to dry as soon as possible. Once dry, brush off excess soil and dirt. Pillows, while washable, usually should be discarded if soaked with contaminated floodwater. Sheets and pillow cases. Put sheets and pillow cases through two complete washing cycles. Use diluted liquid chlorine bleach to help kill germs. Follow your usual drying procedure. Blankets. Put washable blankets (acrylic, cotton) through two complete washing cycles. Air dry or use an automatic dryer at proper tempera-ture settings. Put wool blankets through a drycleaning process either at a commercial coin-operated facility or drycleaning plant. Shrinkage and the difficulty of thorough cleaning make wool blankets troublesome to wash. Quilts and comforters. Wash or dryclean depending on fiber content of the bedding. Usually, it is best to wash cotton quilts.

MATTRESSES As a general rule, inexpensive mattresses are not worth the expense of professional sanitizing and reconditioning. They should be discarded. In some cases, a good inner spring mattress may be worth the cost of reconditioning. Get an estimate from commercial facilities. If the outside of the mattress is only slightly damp, brush off surface soil and wipe with a cloth wrung out of a solution of one cup denatured or rubbing alcohol and one cup water. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Iowa State University Extension, the American Red Cross/Federal Emergency Management Agency, North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension When faced with flood-damaged carpeting and rugs, your options will depend on the source of flooding. If floodwater consisted of clean basement seepage or lawn runoff into a sub-basement, drying and cleaning is an easy decision. But if sewage-contaminated floodwater has covered your carpeting, you probably will need to discard it for health safety reasons. You can assume the water and the carpet contain infectious organisms. Throw rugs can usually be saved. Additional resources: Your county family living agent, your local emergency government office, the American Red Cross, the Federal Emergency Management Agency Related publications: \"Repairing Your Flooded Home,\" American Red Cross/Federal Emergency Management Agency, 1992. GENERAL RULES ® Wall-to-wall carpeting, most large area rugs and any rug with foam backing should be discarded if flooded with contaminated water. Except for valuable rugs, the time and expense of professional cleaning generally is not worth the effort or the health risk. ® If you are determined to salvage carpeting soaked with contaminated water, consult a professional cleaning company that services carpets at its own cleaning and drying facilities. A steam cleaning (hot-water extraction) method is preferable. ® A wall-to-wall carpet soaked by clean rainwater can be salvaged. Have it professionally cleaned or clean it using the directions below. ® Throw rugs usually can be cleaned adequately in a washing machine. CLEANING RAIN-SOAKED CARPETS Cleaning basement carpeting indoors is not a good idea in summer because you are adding even more moisture to an already wet area. If the carpeting is installed with tack strips you may be able to remove it, have it cleaned and reinstalled. Padding is nearly impossible to clean so it should be replaced. If you can\\'t remove the carpeting, dry it as quickly as possible to minimize growth of mildew. If possible, use a wet/dry vacuum system. A dehumidifier can help remove moisture from the air. Keep windows closed when using a dehumidifier. ® When the carpet is thoroughly dry, vacuum the area. ® Shampoo and repeat the drying process. Keep in mind that most modern carpeting is made of nylon and should not be treated with bleach. ® Vacuum again. ® You can reduce a musty smell with the following process: a) Sprinkle baking soda over the carpet, working it in with a broom or sponge mop. b) Leave the baking soda treatment on overnight. c) Vacuum the baking soda out. Vacuum twice, moving back and forth in a different direction the second time.

Have a service person check flooded appliances before you attempt operation or invest a lot of time in clean-up. Deciding which furniture to save may be a more personal issue, especially if you have antiques and other pieces with sentimental value. Keep in mind that you don\\'t need to repair all pieces of salvageable furniture immediately. You can clean, dry and store them in a warm, well-ventilated place until you have time to deal with them. APPLIANCES Before entering a home after a flood, be sure that the electricity to the dwelling has been completely shut off. (See the fact sheet, “Electrical Systems and Appliances.”) Appliances should not be operated until they have been checked by service personnel. Here are some things that may need to be done: Electrical motors may need to be reconditioned or replaced. Wiring and fixtures need to be checked and cleaned. They may also need replacement. Before cleaning and sanitizing an appliance, be sure the motor is in safe working order. It may not be worth the time to clean up the unit. A rust inhibitor may need to be applied to all metal parts. Even though an appliance may not have been submerged, rust can develop from dampness in the air. REFRIGERATORS AND FREEZERS Sanitize the refrigerator or freezer if water has seeped in. Be sure the motor and freezing unit are in safe working order and insulation is not wet. Wet insulation means replacement may be necessary. Remove and wash all shelves, crispers and ice trays. Wash thoroughly with water and detergent. Rinse with a disinfectant solution. Wash the interior of the refrigerator, including the door and door gasket, with hot water and baking soda. Rinse with a disinfectant solution. Leave the door open for about 15 minutes to allow free air circulation. If odor remains, place several pieces of activated charcoal in an open metal container, or use a commercial refrigerator deodorizer. Wash the outside with a mild detergent and hot water. LAUNDRY EQUIPMENT After washers and dryers have been reconditioned, sanitize them as follows: University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension FLOOD-SALVAGING POSSESSIONS more information Additional resources: Your county family living agent, your local emergency government office, the American Red Cross, the Federal Emergency Management Agency Related publications: “Repairing Your Flooded Home,” American Red Cross/Federal Emergency Management Agency, 1992. Pour a disinfectant (chlorine, pine oil or phenolic) into the empty washing machine. Then complete a 15-minute cycle at the “hot” water setting. Unplug the dryer and wipe the drum and door with a cloth dipped in disinfectant solution. Rinse with a cloth dipped in clear water. Leave the dryer door open until all parts are thoroughly dry — preferably overnight. FURNITURE Before starting to salvage damaged furniture, decide which pieces are worth restoring. Such decisions should be based on: the extent of damage, cost of the article, sentimental value and cost of restoration. Antiques are probably worth the time, effort and expense of restoration. Unless damage is severe, you may be able to clean and refinish antiques at home. Don\\'t try to force open swollen wooden doors and drawers. Instead, take off the back of the piece of furniture to let the air circulate. You probably will be able to open the drawers after they dry. Solid wood furniture can usually be restored, unless damage is severe. It probably will need to be cleaned, dried and reglued. Wood alcohol or turpentine applied with a cottonball may remove white mildew spots on wood. Cream wood restorers with lanolin will help restore good wooden furniture parts. Wood veneered furniture is usually not worth the cost and effort of repair, unless it is very valuable. If veneer is loose in just a few places, you may be able to glue it adequately. Upholstered furniture soaks up contaminants from floodwaters and should be cleaned only by a professional. Get a cost estimate to see if furniture is worth saving. Usually, flood-soaked upholstered pieces should be thrown away unless they are antiques or quite valuable. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Minnesota Extension Service, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service, American Red Cross/Federal Emergency Management Agency University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Valuable papers and records should be given maximum protection from any disaster. Water- and fire-resistant file cabinets are available for storing some records at home. A commercial storage area, such as a safe-deposit box, will assure protection from theft and physical damage. Consider making copies of your valuable papers for selected professionals, family members or friends, to assure their prompt availability when needed. Lists of all such documents and the location of each should be stored in more than one place. If important documents or books have been damaged by floodwater, follow the instructions outlined here for drying. However, it is a good idea to photocopy any important papers as a precautionary measure. Even if papers appear to have dried successfully, they may disintegrate rapidly because of substances in the floodwater. KEEP AN UP-To-DATE HOUSEHOLD INVENTORY An inventory of household items and other property is especially valuable in case of a disaster. When making the inventory, do not overlook items kept in cabinets, closets, the freezer, garage and yard. Consider making a video of your inventory and property; at minimum, take some photographs. An accurate inventory will help determine if you have enough insurance to cover the contents of your home. Whenever possible, record the date of purchase and purchase price of items. Keep the inventory current. PAPERS TO BE STORED IN THE HOME Keep the following papers stored at home in a water-proof, fire-proof, locked box: ® Family advisors\\' names and addresses ® Educational, employment and health records ® Copies of birth and marriage certificates, insurance policies ® Driver license numbers, income tax returns, current bank balances, loan payment books ® Guarantees and warranties, appliance manuals, rental property records ® Household inventory, safe-deposit records, one copy of a list of valuable papers and their locations PAPERS TO BE STORED IN A SAFE-DEPOSIT BOX Keep the following papers stored in a safe-deposit box, especially during a disaster: ® Property records, deeds, titles and/or leases ® Copies of wills (his and hers); birth, death and marriage certificates; divorce decrees; adoption or custody papers; citizenship papers; passports; military service records ® Stocks records, bond certificates, contracts (including promissory notes), supporting documents of years of large transactions, unusual losses or deductions ® List of insurance policies, automobile bills of sale and titles, social security cards University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension FLOOD-SALVAGING POSSESSIONS more information Caring for Important Papers STEPS TO TAKE BEFORE AND AFTER A FLOOD Additional resources: Your county family living agent Related publications: “Repairing Your Flooded Home,” the American Red Cross/Federal Emergency Management Agency, 1992. Government savings bonds, religious records, retirement papers, copyrights and patents Household inventory, one copy of a list of valuable papers and their locations DRYING PAPERS AND BOOKS Dry papers and books slowly for best results. Photocopy valuable papers as a precautionary measure because flood-damage may cause rapid deterioration. If you don\\'t have the time to clean and dry them immediately, consider putting them in the freezer to prevent mildewing. Place wax paper between layers of paper bundles or books so they can be separated easily when removed. Wipe book covers with a solution of one part rubbing or denatured alcohol and one part water. Place books on end with leaves separated. When partially dry, pile and press books to keep pages from crumpling. Alternate drying and pressing until books are thoroughly dry. This helps prevent mildew. Use a fan to hasten drying. If papers and books are very damp, sprinkle pages with corn starch or talcum powder to absorb moisture. Leave powder for several hours, then brush it off. For valuable books that are nearly dry, consider pressing the pages with an electric iron set on low. This is a tedious process, but may be worth the effort. Separate the pages to prevent musty odors. Some chemicals help stop mold growth. Contact your county Extension office for recommendations on use. When books are thoroughly dry, close them and use C-clamps to help them retain their shape. Wipe vinyl and leather book covers with a light coating of petroleum jelly or leather or vinyl dressing. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, University of Florida Cooperative Extension Service, North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Salvaging Food After a Flood SAFETY MEASURES IN THE KITCHEN AND GARDEN Food that has come in contact with floodwaters is generally unsafe to eat. Floodwaters usually carry a high load of bacteria and filth with them, and may contain oil or chemical wastes as well. With the exception of canned foods and some produce, most food touched by floodwaters should be discarded. The safety of garden produce depends upon the type of flooding and type of produce. Follow the guidelines at right, which also cover refrigeration and freezer concerns when the power is out. And remember: When in doubt, throw it out. FLOODED ITEMS TO DISCARD Fresh produce, meat, poultry, fish and eggs. Opened containers and packages. Submerged, unopened glass jars that have cardboard lid liners, such as mayonnaise or salad dressing. Submerged, unopened, home-canned jars with broken seals. To check seal, remove ring and test the flat lid with fingertips. If the lid lifts off easily, discard the food. All food in cardboard boxes, paper, foil, cellophane or cloth. Spices, seasonings and extracts, flour, sugar and other staples in canisters. Cans that are dented, leaking, bulging or rusted. FLOODED ITEMS TO SAVE Some fruits, vegetables, and unopened canned goods and glass jars of food can be salvaged. Sanitizing, and in some cases, cooking is necessary for safe use. To sanitize cans and glass jars of food: a) Mark contents on can or jar lid with indelible ink. b) Remove labels. Paper can harbor dangerous bacteria. c) Wash jars and cans in a strong detergent solution with a scrub brush. d) Immerse containers for 10 minutes in a solution of 2 tablespoons chlorine bleach per gallon of room temperature water. e) Allow containers to air dry before opening. Citrus fruits should be washed, sanitized with a light bleach solution (see above) and peeled before eating. Potatoes, carrots, apples and other firm fruits should be sanitized, peeled, if possible, and cooked before eating. Do not eat raw fruit or vegetables, even if they have been sanitized. WHAT ABOUT THE GARDEN? Some garden produce may be salvaged. Sanitizing, peeling and cooking is recommended. Follow these guidelines: University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Flood-Sanitation more information PREVENTION IS THE KEY If it\\'s not too late, prevent floodwater from coming into contact with food by: Raising refrigerators and freezers by placing cement blocks under their corners. Moving food from low cabinets. Moving canned goods and other food stored in the basement to the upstairs.

If the floodwater contained waste from septic tanks, sewage lagoons or a pasture, your garden will take about a month to become clean. Don\\'t eat or preserve food during this time. Ask if your local health department will test the garden soil for harmful bacteria. It may be able to determine whether immature root crops are safe. Discard leafy greens such as lettuce, spinach and cabbage, as well as soft berries. These are highly susceptible to bacterial contamination. Silt and other contaminants may be difficult to remove from them. Wash beans, peas, tomatoes, peppers and summer squash in water. Then soak in a weak chlorine solution of 2 tablespoons chlorine bleach to a gallon of water. Peel and cook them thoroughly before eating. For underground vegetables such as carrots and potatoes, wash in water and sanitize as above. Peel and cook them thoroughly before eating. Produce with a protected fruit or impervious outer skin, such as peas, melons, eggplant, sweet corn or winter squash, should be washed and disinfected before the outer shell, skin or husk is removed. Then shell, peel or husk the produce and cook if possible. REFRIGERATION AND FREEZER CONCERNS If the electricity is off to the refrigerator or freezer, follow these guidelines: Discard refrigerated meats, seafood, milk, soft cheese, eggs, prepared foods and cookie doughs if they have been kept above 40 degrees F. for over two hours. Also discard thawed items that have warmed above 40 degrees F., with the exception of breads and plain cakes. Discard any refrigerated items that turn moldy or have an unusual odor or appearance. Refreeze partially or completely frozen foods. Cold but fully thawed, uncooked meat, fish or poultry should be checked for off-odor. If there is none, cook and eat or cook and refreeze. Discard combination dishes such as stews, casseroles and meat pies if they are thawed. Refreeze thawed (but cold) juices, baked goods and dairy items such as cream, cheese and butter. Do not refreeze thawed vegetables unless ice crystals remain. Cook and use them if there are no off-odors. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Purdue University Cooperative Extension Service, University of Missouri Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Disinfecting Dishes, Cookware and Utensils SAFETY GUIDELINES AFTER A DISASTER During a disaster such as a flood, tornado or fire, kitchen items easily can become contaminated. Floodwaters may contain silt, raw sewage, oil or chemical wastes, while fires may leave residues from toxic fumes or fire-fighting chemicals. Before using any item that has come in contact with these substances, follow the guidelines at right.

DISASSEMBLE, WASH AND DISINFECT Take apart any item that can be cleaned in pieces. If possible, remove handles from pots. If you have a dishwasher and the hot water temperature is at least 140 degrees F., use a long wash cycle and heated drying cycle to clean and disinfect dishwasher-safe items. Regarding other items, or all items if you don\\'t have a dishwasher, follow these steps: Wash all items in a a strong detergent solution. Use a brush to remove dirt. Rinse in hot water. Immerse glass, porcelain, china, plastic dinnerware and enamelware for 10 minutes in a disinfecting solution of 2 tablespoons of chlorine bleach per gallon of hot water. Disinfect silverware, metal utensils, and pots and pans by boiling in water for 10 minutes. Chlorine bleach should not be used in this case because it reacts with many metals and causes them to darken. Air-dry dishes. Do not use a towel. Discard and replace soft, porous plastic or wood items saturated by floodwater, since they cannot be sanitized. These include baby bottles, nipples and pacifiers. If cupboards and counters come in contact with floodwater, clean and rinse them with a chlorine bleach solution before storing dishes. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Michigan State University Cooperative Extension Service, Illinois Cooperative Extension Service, University of Florida Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension FLOOD-SANITATION Flooded Private Sewage Systems SAFETY, SANITATION AND CLEAN-UP CONCERNS Flooding of a private sewage system can be a hazardous situation for homeowners. It may lead to a back-up of sewage in the home, contaminated drinking water and lack of sanitation until the system is fixed. While you don\\'t have control over rainfall or flooding in your area, you can prepare for high water problems and respond appropriately to emergency flooding. HOW PROBLEMS OCCUR When flooding or saturated soil conditions persist, a private sewage system cannot function properly. Soil treatment systems for wastewater rely on aerobic (with oxygen) regions to reduce the amounts of chemicals and living organisms (viruses, bacteria and protozoa). When the soil is saturated or flooded, those hazardous materials can enter the groundwater and your drinking water supply. PREPARING FOR FLOODING If you are prepared when flooding occurs, your family can be safe and your system should survive. To prepare for a flood you should: Make sure all septic tanks are full of liquid. The high-water season is not the time to have tanks pumped; empty tanks are buoyant and may “pop” out of the ground during flooding. Plug floor drains, if necessary, to keep sewage from backing up into the basement. Floodwaters may still enter the basement through cracks and seams, however. DURING A FLOOD Discontinue use of your private sewage system. Use portable toilets, if possible, or use any large container with a tight-fitting lid for a temporary toilet. Line the container with a plastic bag. After each use, add chlorine bleach or disinfectant to stop odor and kill germs. If necessary, bury wastes on high ground far away from your well. Remember that a well may become contaminated during a flood. Therefore, DO NOT DRINK THE WATER. Drink bottled water, or disinfect water before drinking. Contact your local health department for disinfection instructions. Do not bathe or swim in floodwater. It may contain harmful organisms. Shut off power to a sewage lift pump if you have one in the house or in a pump chamber (mound, in-ground pressure, at-grade systems).

Related publications: UW-Extension publication “Care and Maintenance of Residential Septic Systems,” (B3583). AFTER THE FLOOD Do not use the sewage system until water in the disposal field is lower than the water level around the house. If you suspect damage to your septic tank, have it professionally inspected and serviced. Signs of damage include settling or inability to accept water. Most septic tanks are not damaged by a flood since they are below ground and completely covered. However, sometimes septic tanks or pump chambers become filled with silt and debris, and must be professionally cleaned. If tile lines in the disposal field are filled with silt, a new system may have to be installed in new trenches. Because septic tanks may contain dangerous gases, only trained specialists should clean or repair them. Wisconsin code requires licensed plumbers for any repairs. Discard any items that are damaged by contaminated water and cannot be steam cleaned or adequately cleaned and disinfected. Do not pump water out of basements too quickly. Exterior water pressure could collapse the walls. If sewage has backed up into the basement, clean the area and disinfect the floor with a chlorine solution of one-half cup of chlorine bleach to 1 gallon of water. Contact the county health department or county Extension office to obtain a drinking water test kit. (See the fact sheet “Water Contamination in Private Wells.”) Do not drink the water until it has been tested and is safe. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension; the Wisconsin Bureau of Building Water Systems, Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations; Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension After a flood, mosquitoes, flies and other insects may be more abundant than usual, posing potential health problems. Filth and debris left by the storm create excellent breeding conditions for houseflies and mosquitoes, some of which may be capable of spreading typhoid, dysentery and encephalitis. The key to controlling insects is removal of their breeding places–any standing water, especially stagnant water. In warm weather this should be done immediately after you return to the premises. Additional resources: Your county agricultural agent ELIMINATE BREEDING SPOTS ® Empty water from barrels, old tires, cans and other vessels. In addition to being a breeding place for insects, this water may be polluted by floodwaters. Check clogged gutters and flat roofs that have poor drainage. Make sure cisterns, cesspools, septic tanks, fire barrels and rain barrels are covered tightly. ® Drain ponds, pools or any standing water in which mosquitoes may breed. ® If drainage is impossible, treat water puddles still standing after a week with larvicide as recommended by a county Extension agent. ® Dispose of refuse. Bury animal carcasses as soon as possible. Remove garbage at least once every week. Be sure garbage cans have tightly fitting lids. When using manure and garbage as a fertilizer, spread it thinly so it will dry quickly and not support fly development. MAKE REPAIRS Patch screens and other places where mosquitoes may enter buildings. SPRAYS AND REPELLENTS Use a household spray or an aerosol bomb to kill mosquitoes, flies or other insects that get into buildings. Spray shrubbery and shaded areas of buildings to kill adult insects. Contact your county Extension agent for specific recommendations. If possible, keep small children indoors, especially in the evening. If you must go outside at dusk, use a repellent on exposed parts of your body and clothing. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension FLOOD-SANITATION Controlling Insects After Flooding HOW TO MINIMIZE MOSQUITO, FLY AND OTHER INSECT PROBLEMS Rodent and Snake Control After a Flood SAFETY PRECAUTIONS AND ELIMINATION Following floods, rats and other rodents may move into buildings to escape floodwaters. Snakes are often forced into places where they are not usually found. Upon re-entering flooded homes or buildings, you will need to be wary of these possibilities. Rats can carry disease and parasites, while snakes may be poisonous or at least frightening. Neither pose serious problems in Wisconsin, but the chance of an incident increases after a disaster. WHERE THE RATS ARE Because of the danger of rat infestation, use caution when entering flooded buildings: Carry a solid club and a flashlight. Inspect likely hiding places for rats. Check closets, drawers, mattresses, appliances, upholstered furniture, stacks of clothes or paper, dark corners, attics and basements. Be extremely careful when approaching rats. They may be aggressive. CONTROLLING RATS If rats continue to be a problem after floodwaters recede, contact your county Extension agent or professional pest control operator for advice. If you proceed on your own be extremely careful with any rodenticide or trap. To minimize rat problems: Remove trash piles and piles of damaged furniture or equipment. Store materials on platforms or shelves 12 to 18 inches above the ground. Remove food sources. Store food supplies in rat-proof bins or containers. Suspend garbage containers from trees or posts. Remove animal carcasses, as they may attract rats. If you are bitten by a rat, wash the wound with soap and water and see a doctor immediately. Rats may carry diseases and at the least, rat bites can cause infection. If the rat is captured or killed, health authorities may wish to check it for rabies or other diseases. When picking up a carcass, use the inside of a plastic bag to avoid touching it. Double-seal it in plastic and freeze until further notice. INSPECTING FOR SNAKES It is important to know what poisonous snakes may be common to your area. Only two poisonous snakes exist in Wisconsin: the timber rattlesnake and the massasauga rattlesnake. Both species are restricted to the southwest quarter of the state. The massasauga is an endangered species and is rarely encountered. Non-poisonous snakes, however, are common and may bite. Remember that all snakes are beneficial to the ecosystem and should not be killed indiscriminately — poisonous snakes included. But follow these precautions upon entering a flooded structure or area: University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension FLOOD-SANITATION more information Additional resources: Your county agricultural agent Related publications: UW-Extension Publications– “Snakes of Wisconsin,” (G3139); “The Raccoon,” (G3304); “Skunks: How to Deal With Them,” (G3273); “Meadow Mouse Control,” (A2148); “Tree Squirrels in Wisconsin: Benefits and Problems,” (G3522). Be alert for snakes in unusual places. They may be found in or around homes, barns, outbuildings, driftwood, levees, dikes, dams, stalled automobiles, piles of debris, building materials, trash or any type of rubble or shelter. Keep a heavy stick or long-handled tool handy. After dark, carry a strong light. Before beginning rescue or clean-up operations, search the premises thoroughly for snakes. Wear heavy leather or rubber high-top boots, and heavy gloves. Use rakes, pry bars or other long-handled tools when removing debris. Never expose your hands, feet or other parts of your body where a snake might be. Explain to children the dangers of snakes during storm or flood conditions and the precautions they should follow. Do not allow children to play around debris. If you kill a poisonous snake, use a stick, rake or other long-handled tool to carry it away for disposal. If you realize you are near a snake, remain still—sudden movements may cause the snake to strike. If the snake doesn\\'t move away from you after a few minutes, slowly back away from it. If someone is bitten by a poisonous snake, call a doctor immediately. If bitten by a non-poisonous snake, clean the wound and watch for signs of infection. CONTROLLING SNAKES To minimize chances of finding snakes indoors, block openings where they might enter buildings. Snakes can pass through extremely small openings and usually enter near or below ground level. Some other suggestions: Be sure doors, windows and screens fit tightly. Search walls and floors for holes or crevices. Inspect the masonry of foundations, fireplaces and chimneys. Then plug or cement these openings. Plug spaces around pipes that go through outside walls. Fasten galvanized screen over drains or ventilators, or over large areas of loose construction. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Salvaging Stored Wet Feed and Grain DRYING, MARKETING AND SAFE FEEDING Time is of the essence in salvaging wet feed and grain. Both will begin to heat and mold very quickly, leading to spoilage as well as the possibility of spontaneous combustion. As soon as possible, you should remove dry portions of grain and store them separately. Dry bales of hay should be removed and restacked in a dry location, since capillary action will draw water up into the stack. Wet feeds should be presumed harmful to animals until tested. They may contain contaminants from floodwaters, as well as mold spores which sometimes produce dangerous toxins. USE DRYER IF POSSIBLE If part of a grain bin has been flooded, remove dry grain from the top using a vacuvator or any other means. Use one of the following methods for handling wet grain: Get the wet grain to a dryer quickly, if possible. This is the surest way to save wet grain. If the grain depth can be kept below 6 feet, use a natural-air bin drying system with a perforated floor and a high-capacity drying fan. Sup-plemental heat should only be used during periods of high humidity. Do not raise the air temperature more than 10 or 15 degrees F. If a dryer is not available, spread the grain in as dry a place as possible. Don\\'t pile it any higher than 6 inches. Stir it daily to prevent overheating and to speed drying. Watch for and remove molded grains. Wet grain can be ensiled if it is intended for feed and the moisture content ranges between 25 and 35 percent. If using a conventional silo, see your county agricultural agent about treating the grain with proprionic acid to prevent mold. DRY AND SHELL WET EAR CORN Separate dry corn from wet and store it on high ground. If the ground is wet, first cover the area with plastic or building paper. Handle wet ear corn as follows: Dry the corn if facilities and equipment are available. Remove corn from crib, since mud and debris washed into the crib may make drying difficult or impossible. Then place the ear corn over a drying tunnel and force air through the corn with a fan. Shell the corn if shelling equipment is available. GUARD AGAINST HAY FIRES Flooded hay should be disposed of or used on fields as a fertilizer. It is probably unsafe for animals and not worth the time and expense of drying. Because of hay\\'s tendency to heat and mold quickly, it should be spread out to aerate as soon as possible and turned often. Hay bales that are 30 to 40 percent wet pose the greatest risk of fire. Check hay storage often for pungent odors, hot damp areas on the stack, emission of water vapors and other signs of heating. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension FLOOD-FARM RECOVERY more information REPLACING HAY WITH GRAIN If you must replace conventional roughage feeds with grain because of flooding, consider fibrous grains such as oats, barley, ground ear corn or one of the high-fiber byproducts such as brewers grains, corn gluten feed or soy hulls. Continue to feed hay or straw unless you have had experience with high grain feeding. You must maintain a minimum amount of forage in cattle diets. Check with your nutritionist or county agricultural agent for guidelines. Spread any major changes in a feeding program over a period of several days. Observe animals carefully during the transition. Additional resources: Consult your veterinarian or county agricultural agent before using flood-damaged feeds. To check a stack\\'s temperature for fire risk, drive a sharp pointed pipe into the hay, lower a thermometer inside the pipe, and leave it there for about 20 minutes. At 150 degrees F., the hay is approaching the danger zone. At 170 degrees F., hot spots or fire pockets are possible. Have the fire department on standby. FIND A LOCAL MARKET If it is not possible to dry grain artificially, try to find a local market for it. Usable flood-damaged grain must be sold at a salvage price, possibly to a large livestock feeder who can use it before it spoils. Grain should be kept in airtight storage to prevent spoilage. SEED GRAIN AND SILAGE OFTEN A LOSS Wet seed grain probably will not be suitable for seed, as wetness causes the seed to germinate. Subsequent drying would stop germination and likely kill the seed or reduce its viability. Do not feed seed grain to livestock, since it may contain toxic additives. Flooded silage likewise will be a loss. Its waterlogged state will hurt feed value, as will any contaminants from the water. Like hay, it might be spread on fields as a fertilizer. SAFETY WITH WATER-DAMAGED FEEDS Testing. Do not feed flood-damaged grains until they are tested for mycotoxins, toxic substances produced by fungi. Ask your county Extension agent for locations of testing laboratories. Even if the feed is deemed safe to use, watch animals carefully for signs of illness. Nutritive value. Mixed feeds, grains and roughages which have heated or spoiled will have little nutritive value for livestock, depending on the extent of the damage. Safety. Do not feed heated, molded or sour feeds, or moldy legume hays (such as alfalfa or clover) to any livestock. Reduced performance, sickness, abortion or death may occur. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service, University of Missouri Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Maintaining Livestock Health After a Flood ISSUES OF DISEASE CONTROL AND SANITATION If your fields or farm buildings have been flooded, take special precautions against flood-related accidents or diseases in poultry and livestock. Give animals extra care, particularly if they have been stranded by floodwater, and have been off regular feeding schedules. Keep fields clear of harmful debris, and clean buildings as soon as possible. In addition, watch for signs of flood-related diseases, such as lameness, fever, difficulty breathing, muscle contractions or swelling of shoulder, chest, back, neck or throat. Be prepared to contact a veterinarian if you spot trouble. DISEASE CONTROL Following a flood there may be danger of infectious diseases in livestock, but unless serious outbreaks of infection have occurred recently, the situation should not be alarming. Observe these precautions: Where large numbers of animals are assembled, watch for any indication of infectious diseases such as pneumonia, foot rot or leptospirosis. These diseases are more likely to occur where cattle are crowded on wet ground and where horn flies and houseflies are abundant. Promptly report any sign of disease to a local, state or federal veterinarian. Contact a veterinarian about vaccinating animals for immunity from flood-related diseases such as anthrax, blackleg and swine erysipelas. FEED AND WATER Provide clean, uncontaminated water. Inspect feeds such as corn, wheat and hay. Do not feed flood-damaged or moldy hay unless it has been tested for mycotoxins, toxic substances produced by fungi. Do not use any feed or forage that may have been contaminated by chemicals or pesticides. PASTURELAND Standing water may have ruined some pastures. Lack of adequate forage could force animals to eat poisonous plants. Remove fallen wild cherry limbs from pastures to prevent livestock poisoning. Before restocking flooded pastures, remove debris, especially along fence lines and in corners. Livestock could be injured from pieces of barbed wire, sharp metal and trash. PROTECTING DAIRY COWS Try to milk at regular times. It is better to lose the milk from one milking than to stress high producing cows. If you must use a neighbor\\'s milking parlor, try to keep the two herds separate. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension FLOOD-FARM RECOVERY more information Additional resources: Your county agricultural agent, your local veterinarian If feed supplies are limited, give the largest portion of available feed to the highest producing cows and those recently fresh. This may be a good time to cull the herd. Clean and sanitize milking parlor, dairy barn and equipment before returning to normal use. Watch for signs of mastitis, which is likely to flare up if milking methods, time and equipment have been changed. SANITATION Clean out hog houses, barns and chicken houses. Spray buildings with a good disinfectant before animals occupy them again. Air buildings thoroughly to dry them out. Remove debris from dairy barns. Scrub and disinfect walls, ceilings, floors, stanchions and other equipment. Scrub the milk house and equipment with detergent and hot water. Sanitize equipment, walls, ceilings and floors with dairy sanitizer equipment. Dispose of animal carcasses promptly. If there is no rendering company operating nearby, burn or bury carcasses deeply in a place approved by your local soil conservation office. INSECTS Mosquitoes and other pests may be abundant after a flood. They not only annoy animals, but some species carry disease. Spray animals with an insect repellent as recommended by your county agricultural agent. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Flooded Farm Vehicles and Equipment TIPS ON CLEANING AND RECONDITIONING Try to clean tractors, trucks and farm equipment as soon as possible. Delay will make dirt and silt harder to remove and may cause considerable rusting and corrosion. If you use farm vehicles and equipment before proper reconditioning, you may seriously damage them. Have your dealer or another expert recondition engines. They need to be completely disassembled for cleaning and reconditioning. Do not try to move or start an engine that has been submerged until it has been cleaned and reconditioned, since dirt will damage bearings and precision parts. If the tractor was submerged only to the platform, you will need to service only the wheel bearings and moving parts that were under water. EMERGENCY CLEANING If you must use the tractor or engine immediately, or if you think the cost of professional reconditioning is not worthwhile, use the following procedure. This procedure isn\\'t thorough enough to prevent possible damage or need for overhaul in the future. Clean exterior thoroughly with a hose. Scrub greasy deposits with solvent. Remove spark plugs or fuel injectors, air cleaner, intake manifold and carburetor. Clean these parts thoroughly with solvent. Drain the crankcase. Flush the crankcase with oil and refill with clean oil. Also disconnect fuel lines, blowing them out with compressed air. Crank the engine slowly with spark plugs or fuel injectors removed to force water out of cylinders. Squirt light lubricating oil into each cylinder and let it stand for about five minutes. Then crank the engine slowly to lubricate cylinder walls and rings. Replace all filters — engine, fuel, hydraulic. Completely flush out the fuel system — tank, pump, lines — with 1 diesel fuel. Be extremely careful to avoid fire danger. Replace starter and generator. Have an expert service them. Drain and flush the transmission and final drive with solvent. Refill with new, clean oil. WHEEL BEARINGS, COOLING SYSTEMS AND BATTERIES Remove and clean unsealed wheel and track bearings with solvent. Lubricate and replace the bearings. Factory-sealed bearings should not need cleaning if the seal is unbroken. Flush the cooling systems with fresh water, and clean the radiator fins. Replace the battery, if necessary. If it was submerged, it will probably need to be replaced. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension FLOOD-FARM RECOVERY more information Additional resources: Your county agricultural agent STARTING AND INITIAL OPERATION Examine the machine and turn it over by hand after you have cleaned and replaced all parts. If it turns freely, it is probably ready for operation. Turn on the engine and operate the machine at low speed until you are sure all parts are working smoothly. If there is a substantial amount of dirt in the crankcase, transmission or gear train, change the oil and oil filter after operating the machine for a few hours. Using fresh lubricant is cheaper than paying for additional repairs. ADDITIONAL STEPS FOR TRUCKS AND CARS Remove inside door panels. Clean and lubricate latches and window raising mechanisms. Remove seats and floor mats. Brush and vacuum thoroughly. Clean washable surfaces with soap and water. Use rug or upholstery shampoo on non-washable areas. Dry thoroughly. Disassemble leaf springs. Clean or replace spring pads if necessary. Have brakes and steering mechanism checked before you drive the vehicle. RECONDITIONING FARM IMPLEMENTS Follow applicable steps above, and clean rest of machine as follows: Chains. Soak chains in solvent for several hours, then remove chains and allow solvent to drain out of them. Soak chains for several hours in light oil, then drain off excess oil and replace chains on machine. Gears and sprockets. Clean exposed gears and sprockets with cleaning solvent. Coat gears with light oil. Gear cases. Inspect enclosed gear cases for water or grit. Water may be present below the oil. If you find water or grit, or if you are in doubt, drain the case, flush it with solvent and refill with clean oil. Belts. Examine all belts for tears or cracks. Repair or replace them as necessary. Cutting parts. Remove knives and cutter bars from mowers and combines. Clean and dry them. Coat cutter parts with light oil and reassemble. Inspect the insides of combines and remove accumulated dirt, chaff, debris or water. Soil-working tools. Clean dirt and rust from surfaces of soil-working tools such as mold boards, discs and cultivator shovels. Coat these tools with rust preventive grease or used crankcase oil. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Tips for Handling Flooded Soils CLEAN-UP, SOIL TESTING AND COVER CROPS If sediment came from fertile fields of your upstream neighbors, the fertility status of the field will probably be unchanged or higher than before the flood. If heavy sedimentation occurs, these soils should be tested to determine nutrient status. Take soil samples at a 6- to 8-inch depth in at least 15 locations per field. Each soil sample should represent 20 acres or less. Areas with significant differences in textures should be sampled separately. Sand deposits may have to be removed or spread over other areas and mixed with the more productive soil beneath. Sand deposits on top of silty or clay-type soils deeper than 4 inches may decrease potential crop yields. Determine the location, depth and amount of coverage of sand. Call your county Extension agent for further guidelines. Additional resources: Your county agricultural agent, Soil Conservation Service Related publications: UW-Extension Publications– “Management of Wisconsin Soils,” (A3588); “Sampling Soils for Testing,” (A2100). GENERAL GUIDELINES Open all drainage ditches. Remove debris from fields and pastures. Look carefully for partially hidden objects that could injure livestock or damage machinery. Check hedge and fence rows carefully. To prevent severe soil compacting, avoid running trucks and heavy farm equipment over wet soils. Most soils are not dry enough for traffic or cultivation until the top 5 or 6 inches crumble, rather than slick over or pack. Encourage the growth of cover crops such as rye or wheat. Any type of plant growth is effective in drying waterlogged soils. It is usually not necessary to remove silt deposits. After soils are dry enough to work, level and mix silt deposits into original topsoil, if practical. Apply animal manure and incorporate into soil. Check with your county Extension agent for recommended application rates. The fertility level of flooded soils will probably change over a period of time. Do not guess at requirements. Take soil samples to determine new fertility levels. Follow recommendations. Allow for nutrients supplied by applied animal manures. When sampling silted fields, make sure the samples represent the soil mix that will exist after deposited silt is mixed with the original topsoil. Avoid deep tillage or subsoiling unless advised by an agronomist. Deep tillage or subsoiling is rarely beneficial and could be harmful. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, University of Missouri Cooperative Extension Service, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension FLOOD-FARM RECOVERY Salvaging Crops After Flooding RECOVERY OF ALFALFA, IRRIGATED PASTURES AND HAY Many factors affect the extent of crop damage after a flood. Seasonal temperatures can be a major factor. A July flood, for example, is often much worse for crop survival than a spring flood. The warmer mid-summer weather increases the rate of damage and death to submerged plants. During spring flooding, temperatures are colder and plants can survive longer under water. Plants that encounter flash-flooding along creeks where the water rises and recedes quickly are most likely to survive. They will experience less oxygen depletion than submerged plants. Other factors for survival include water movement and plant height. Standing water is more harmful than moving water. Plants with some leaves protruding from the water are more likely to live. Restoration of alfalfa, irrigated pastures, perennials and hay will depend heavily on all of these factors. But it also depends on the steps you take toward recovery. ALFALFA Alfalfa can withstand submersion for a limited time, depending on its stage of growth. Dormant plants may withstand submersion for as long as seven to 10 days. Growing plants can usually withstand submersion for less than three to four days without damage. Alfalfa can recover from moderate silt deposits. Silt deposits of over 2 to 3 inches will weaken the stand, and you may need to regrade and re-establish in places. Limit reseeding of established fields to silted patches within the field. If the entire field is silted, rework and reseed the field. Where alfalfa stand is over two years old, overseed with temporary crop and reseed alfalfa at least one month after having reworked the field. You can reseed small areas with fast-growing grasses. This will help provide forage until the entire field can be reworked. In old fields, seeding to annual crops such as ryegrass will provide some hay and also will help control weeds. IRRIGATED PASTURES You probably can restore irrigated pastures without serious production losses if silt deposits are not over 2 inches and erosion is minimal. Recovery usually depends on the type of legume. Alfalfa probably will recover from moderate silting better than white clover varieties. White clover will not survive silting that covers the ends of the growing stems or stolons. Ladino clover, however, will fill in stands from a few surviving plants if the area is not too large. Grasses such as ryegrass, orchardgrass, fescue and meadow foxtail will probably grow through a moderate silt deposit, and can stand several days of flooding without injury. Tall fescue will tolerate more water than ryegrass or orchardgrass. Meadow foxtail and reed canary grass can stand longer submersion than other perennial grasses. Subsurface water saturating the root zone of deep-rooted crops such as alfalfa can damage the plant as much as surface water. To take care of excess soil moisture, open drainage ditches as soon as possible. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension FLOOD-FARM RECOVERY more information Additional resources: Your county agricultural agent OVERLY MATURE PERENNIALS Some overly mature alfalfa or clover grass can be partially salvaged by mixing with less mature forage and ensiling the crop. Although nutritional value will be low, this is a fast method of removing the crop to ensure a good second cutting. Ensile perennials in either conventional upright or temporary trench silos. To make a trench silo: Locate the trench where drainage is good. Design the trench for efficient feeding. A long, narrow, deep trench results in less feeding loss than a wide, shallow trench. To make the silage: Direct cut or wilt to 65 to 70 percent moisture. Chop fine. Pack thoroughly. If available, add 100 to 200 pounds of corn and cob chop per ton of ensiled nutrients. This will improve fermentation, quality and palatability. HAY To minimize damage to flooded hay crops: Remove old growth from fields that have not been harvested. This will encourage a good aftermath crop. Make this crop into hay or silage. If crop is silt-damaged, chop it uniformly back onto the field. Then topdress immediately with fertilizer. You also may want to apply nitrogen to stimulate legumes as well as grasses. Check with an agronomist for recommended application rates. On fields harvested just prior to the flood, make crop into hay or silage. Then topdress field with fertilizer. Check with your county agricultural agent for specific recommendations. If growth is short or yellow, topdress immediately. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, University of Missouri Extension, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Weed Management After a Flood STRATEGIES FOR THIS YEAR AND NEXT Floods can affect weeds both the year they occur and in subsequent years. The biggest impact in the flood year will be the reduced competitive ability of the crop. Weeds will take advantage of the stunted or killed crops and grow to maturity. In the year after a flood, new weed problems will be likely. Some of the weeds carried into the field by floodwaters may not have germinated in time to be noticed during the previous growing season. Mechanical and chemical methods need to be considered in both the flood year and subsequent years to manage weeds. A bioassay test—in which seeds are planted in flooded and non-flooded soil samples—can be helpful to determine if soils are safe for intended crops. IF THE CROP RECOVERS If the crop recovers after the flood, make an effort to reduce the impact of weed competition. This may not be practical if fields are too wet to enter for mechanical or chemical weeding. Check fields regularly to monitor crop and weed development. Take note of weed species. Are there any new species? This may happen if weed seeds were carried into the field by floodwater. Make a field map of these weed locations and use it to plan next year\\'s weed management program. Consider whether herbicides can be safely applied. Most labels clearly specify the maximum growth stage of the crop at which the product can be used. Applications following a mid-season flood are very likely beyond this “window” of application timing. Most labels also caution against using herbicides if the crop is under any stress. Thus, the feasibility of herbicide use the same year as a flood occurs is limited. If herbicide use is feasible but conditions are extremely wet, consider using a commercial sprayer equipped with flotational tires. WHEN CROPS ARE DAMAGED Flooding usually kills the crop or at least injures it so severely that it will not be be worth harvesting. If this is the case, try to prevent weeds from going to seed through the use of mowing, tillage or chemical application. As mentioned above, take note of any new weed species that are present. Make a field map of the weeds to plan next year\\'s weed control program. Mowing will allow some weeds to survive but may hasten drying of the soil more than using herbicides. Mowing is also an option if the soil is too wet to be tilled. Mechanically tilling the soil, if it is dry enough, will destroy weeds. It will also aerate the soil more than either mowing or spraying. Applying non-selective, non-residual herbicides may be a good option if the soil is too wet to work mechanically. Repeat either mowing, tillage or chemical application if another generation of weeds emerges that will have time to produce seed. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension FLOOD-FARM RECOVERY more information FINAL DECISIONS Should you allow even more time than product labels specify before planting rotation crops? Probably not if you have used DNAs (as noted in chart), but it\\'s difficult to say for other chemicals. Consider whether floodwaters brought in untreated soil from other fields. Also consider whether runoff removed a significant part of the applied product. When in doubt, use the bioassay test described at right or send a soil sample to a commercial lab for chemical analysis. In some cases it may be appropriate to allow an extra week or two beyond the normal plant-back interval and deep till the field to dilute any remaining residues. Once the field has been planted, monitor it carefully for possible weed problems. If weed densities approach the economic threshold, use the appropriate mechanical or chemical measures to control them. Additional resources: Your county agricultural agent THE YEAR AFTER THE FLOOD Be alert for new weed problems the year after the flood. Some weeds may have germinated after you made an assessment of weeds during the flood year. Others may have remained dormant until this season. The flood may also have deposited soil that is different in texture, pH and organic matter content. These factors may influence herbicide performance and crop safety. Take soil samples and base herbicide selection and rates on current soil characteristics. The “new soil” may have herbicide residues from the previous season\\'s application. These levels are unlikely to affect this year\\'s crop, but it would be wise to do a simple bioassay test to determine if planned crops are feasible in the flood-deposited soil. To carry out a bioassay test: Take several soil samples from the flooded field (1 quart per sample) and plant three or four seeds of the planned crop in each one. Collect soil samples from a known herbicide-free site to use as a standard and likewise plant three or four seeds of the planned crop. Grow the seedlings for two to four weeks. If plants in the flooded soil are normal and appear to grow as well as those in the herbicide-free soil, indications are strong that it is safe to plant your crop. If crop growth in the flooded soil is abnormal, have an agricultural professional determine if the symptoms are related to possible herbicide residues in the soil or to other causes, such as nutrient deficiencies or diseases. A CLOSER LOOK AT HERBICIDES Herbicides decompose in the soil by microbial action. This breakdown is slowed under flooded (anaerobic) conditions. Soil temperatures also are cooler under flooded and wet soil conditions, slowing both microbial and chemical degradation. Thus, the potential for herbicide carryover that would injure the subsequent crop may increase after flooding. A summary of possible effects of flooding on herbicide breakdown is given below: Degradation Under Product or Chemical Family Anaerobic Conditions Triazines (atrazine, Bladex, Sencor) slower Thicarbamates (Eradicane, Sutan+) slower DNAs (Treflan, Prowl) faster Acetanailides (Lasso, Dual, Frontier) can degrade anaerobically Substituted ureas (Lorox) unknown Roundup can degrade anaerobically Accent and Beacon unknown Hoelon much slower Poast, Fusilade, Assure unknown Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension d r o u g h t Drought Preparedness and Response STRATEGIES FOR FARMERS Of all natural disasters, drought is the most gradual and hard to predict. Once it has affected crop growth, farmers and producers enter a new territory of what if\\'s. What if it rains next week? What if it doesn\\'t rain for a month? Alternative crops may have to be planted or crop loss assistance applied for. If feed supplies are low, herds may have to be culled and/or feeds purchased. For farmers who were already facing financial hardship, a drought can force major decisions about diversification, irrigation, surviving a major loss or even selling the farm. The fact that Wisconsin suffered record droughts as recently as 1976-77 and 1988 underscores the fact that droughts are a natural occurrence. Fortunately, farmers can take some actions to better prepare for and survive a drought. The key is a combination of sound farmstead planning and sound decision-making, based on advice and up-to-date information from resources like your Cooperative Extension Service. BE PREPARED Examine your water use efficiency and irrigation needs. If you already irrigate, contact your agricultural agent about using the Wisconsin Irrigation Scheduling Program (WISP). This research-based program assists growers in determining frequency and amounts of irrigation (if any) throughout the growing season; it can be extremely helpful during a drought. If you do not currently irrigate, consult with your agricultural agent and irrigation system dealers now — before a drought occurs. Emergency irrigation systems are difficult to put in place because of the permitting process (which may take 30 days or more) and possible lack of equipment mid-season (dealers generally sell equipment during the winter and spring). Look carefully at irrigation systems as a long-term investment. Keep up-to-date forage inventories. Accurate forage inventories in silos, hay mows and other storage areas help you determine feed supplies during a drought. Note the amount and accessibility of each lot of uniform quality forage. Your local feed representative or agricultural agent can assist you with this process. Consider alternative on-farm related businesses (AOFRB). Diversification can be a good long-term approach to revenue shortfalls from drought. Some potential businesses include: a) Alternative crops such as shiitake mushrooms, ginseng, specialty vegetables, greenhouse plants, dried and/or cut flowers, etc. b) Alternative livestock, such as llamas, ducks, bees, deer for venison or mink. c) Forestry, including cord wood, maple syrup, apple orchards and Christmas trees. d) Non-production farm-related ventures such as camping, fee hunting/shooting preserves, trout ponds, farm vacations, bed and breakfast establishments, summer camps on the farm, herd sitting, boat and camper storage, and farm markets. e) Home-based enterprises including sewing projects, crafts, catering services, upholstery, secretarial service/word processing, taxidermy, etc. Contact your Cooperative Extension office or your Small Business Development Center for more information. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension more information AFTER A DROUGHT Financial issues. Continue to pursue government drought assistance programs if you have not yet received relief; your county Extension office can help you through the application process. Also, see your accountant about tax issues related to the drought. If you received federal disaster payments, you may be able to postpone reporting them on your income taxes for a year. Likewise, if you sold livestock because of the drought, you may be able to postpone reporting gains on the sale for as long as two years afterward. Crop testing for feed. Nutritional values of crops are often affected by drought. Have fresh forage tested for high nitrate levels and nutritional value. Have oats and barley tested for nutritional value; nitrates usually are not a problem. Consult with your livestock nutritionist about corn quality and use. Test for mycotoxins in grain fields. Soil testing. Because of the potential for herbicide and fertilizer carryover, soil testing is very important following a drought year. See the fact sheets “Fertilizer Application After a Drought,” and “Herbicide Concerns After a Drought Year,” for test recommendations. Additional resources: Your county agricultural agent DURING A DROUGHT Discuss financial and feed assistance in the early phase of a drought. The earlier you enroll in feed assistance or financial assistance programs, the sooner you will be eligible for help. See your county agricultural agent about eligibility for grants, loans and other types of assistance. Likewise, contact your lender about potential problems before you are in over your head. You may be able to renegotiate current payment plans and establish an emergency plan if the drought persists and additional financing is needed. Look to your county agricultural agent for up-to-date information on managing during a drought. As part of a network of county, state and national research and field experts, your agent receives new informa-tion daily on managing during a drought. If your agent doesn\\'t have the answer to your question, he or she can find the answer or refer you to the person for help. Adjust fertilizer rates. If you haven\\'t already applied fertilizers, adjust your rates based on lower yield expectancy for the drought year. If little or no production is expected, consider skipping an application. Be prepared to use mechanical weed control. Many herbicides lose effectiveness during dry periods, making mechanical weed control your second line of defense against weeds. Protect livestock from heat. Adequate water, shade and ventilation in buildings are critical during hot, humid weather . Consider letting livestock out of buildings to cool them at night. Call a veterinarian if heat stress is a concern. Consider alternative crops. If your fields have less than 12 alfalfa plants per square foot or a 75 percent reduction in corn stand population, consider alternative forages. Some possibilities include sudangrass, sorghum-sudan hybrids, milage and millet. Corn silage might be the best forage alternative; even the worst fields have silage potential. Discuss possible options with your agricultural agent. Cull unprofitable cattle. If forage is inadequate, selling unprofitable livestock may be your next best move. Consider culling the bottom 5 to 15 percent. Review your options and the economics of the situation with Extension agents. Recognize the early warning signs of emotional stress. Stress can overwhelm farmers and their families. Some of the warning signs of severe stress include anxiety, depression, anger, violence and withdrawal. If you see these signs in yourself, a family member or friend, get outside assistance. Professional counselors, a clergy member or social worker can help, as well as the Farmers Assistance Hotline for Wisconsin at (800) 942-2474. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Protecting Livestock From Heat STRATEGIES FOR FARMERS WHEN TEMPERATURES CLIMB When temperatures and humidity begin to rise in Wisconsin, keep a close eye on livestock. Temperatures in the high 80s and the 90s can cause problems, as well as a 75 degree F. day coupled with high humidity. Heat stress can cause general discomfort, decline in animal performance and animal death. PROVIDE SHADE AND NIGHT-TIME COOLING If animals are kept outside, provide shade during hot weather. Heat from the sun is a major culprit in overstressed animals. Swine may sunburn during hot, sunny weather. Try to keep them out of the sun. Sun shades can cut the radiant heat load by as much as 40 percent; ask your county Extension agent for information on their construction. Pasture wallows are also effective for sunburn protection and wet skin cooling. Turn cows outside at night to cool them and cool the barn. Since animals cool themselves primarily through breathing, barns tend to get warm and humid quickly. PROVIDE ADEQUATE WATER Ample drinking water is vital to animals during hot and humid conditions. Animals cool themselves by panting (water loss from the lungs) and through water evaporation from the skin. Increased respiration during hot weather is especially important for pigs and other animals that do not sweat. Animals must replace the water loss to cool themselves. Maintain access to water. Provide automatic drinking cups so animals can meet their requirements during hot weather. Keep water containers clean. Adjust the drinking space for the size and number of animals in the pen or group. Excessive volumes of water grow warm and stale throughout the day. (See the fact sheet “Livestock Water and Nutrition.”) Check the water delivery systems periodically for plugs or other problems. If necessary, spray water on animals to cool them. PROVIDE GOOD VENTILATION Proper ventilation helps maintain livestock health during hot and humid weather. Without adequate air exchanges and airflow distribution within livestock buildings, heat and moisture accumulate and animal production is affected. Contact a ventilation specialist to inspect and update your system, if necessary. Your county Extension office also may be able to help you. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension DROUGHT-FARM DROUGHT more information Additional resources: Your county agricultural agent, ventilation specialists, your veterinarian Related publications: UW-Extension publications– “When Temperatures Go Up, Does Your Milk Production Go Down?” (A2881); “Cooling Swine,” (PIH87). Midwest Plan Service publications– “Heating, Cooling and Tempering Air for Livestock Housing,” (MWPS-34); “Mechanical Ventilating Systems for Livestock Housing,” (MWPS-32). BE WATCHFUL Use the temperature humidity index as a guide to heat stress. Listen to local or regional weather reports for the temperature humidity index (THI) for your area. Some levels of concern include: a) Above 75 THI - Heat stress on high-producing cows begins to decrease feed intake and lower milk production. b) Above 80 THI - Severe heat stress may occur for cows on pasture. Shade and adequate ventilation are essential to minimize milk loss. c) Above 83-85 THI - Danger of fatal heat stress occurs. Keep an eye on animals. If heat stress is a concern, check animal temperature. Dairy cow temperatures approaching 104 to 106 degrees F. are dangerous. At 107 degrees F., spontaneous heart failure is possible. Call a veterinarian and use methods listed above to keep animals cool. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Managing Livestock During a Drought WHEN WATER AND FEED SUPPLIES BECOME A CONCERN Drought usually gets its reputation from its impact on crops. But its impact on livestock can be equally dramatic. Hot, dry weather increases the water needs of livestock but often decreases water supplies. Crops may not yield as planned, causing a feed shortage. Consequently, farmers may face special challenges, including decisions about whether to buy feed or sell livestock. WATER REQUIREMENTS Water requirements may increase to double the normal intake for animals during hot weather. Clean, fresh water is important. If animals do not meet their water needs, they may refuse to eat, experience lowered production, become sick or die. Water supplies also may become a problem as the drought wears on. Wells and piping may be inadequate if water demand increases dramatically; shallow wells and streams may dry up. You may need to transport water. Contact your local emergency government office or your county Extension office for information on water supply assistance. Some general water estimates for various conditions and animals: Daily water intake for beef cattle at 88 degrees F.: a) Cows -16.5 gallons for nursing calves; 14 gallons for bred dry cows and heifers. b) Bulls - 18 gallons. c) Growing cattle - 9 gallons for 400 lb. animal; 12 for 600 lb.; 14 for 800 lb. d) Finishing cattle - 14 for 600 lb. animal; 17 for 800 lb.; 20 for 1,000 lb.; 22.5 for 1,200 lb. Daily water intake for dairy cattle at 80 degrees F.: a) Dry cows (for maintenance and pregnancy) - 16.2 gallons for 1,400 lb. animal; 17.3 for 1,700 lb. b) Lactating, 1,400-lb. cows (for maintenance and milk production) - 17.9 gallons for 20 lb. milk production; 24.7 for 60 lb. milk production; 38.7 for 80 lb. milk production; 45.7 for 100 lb. milk production. c) Heifers - 3.3 gallons for 200 lb. animal; 6.1 for 400 lb.; 10.6 for 800 lb.; 14.5 for 1,200 lb. (for maintenance and pregnancy). Average daily water intake for swine: a) Breeding herd - 2 to 3 gallons for gestating sows and boars; 4 to 5 gallons for lactating sows. b) Young pigs - One-half to 1 gallon for weaned pigs (15-50 lb.); 1 gallon for growing pigs (50-120 lb.); 1.5-2 gallons for finishing pigs (120 lb. to market). Increase amounts for hot, dry conditions.

WHEN FEED BECOMES AN EMERGENCY Feed supplies may run low if crops are compromised or lost because of dry weather. Farmers unable to afford additional feed may face an emergency situation. Some considerations include: Develop an inventory of livestock numbers and feed supplies. An inventory will help you plan for current and long-term feed needs. Get advice and assistance. When a feed shortage is imminent, contact a nutritionist or your county Extension office for guidance, your lender for early discussion of potential problems or needs and the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) for feed assistance program information. Two major options when facing a feed shortage are to: a) Buy or obtain additional feed. Feed assistance may be available from relief groups, the ASCS or through loans. Volunteer organizations typically offer hay lifts during drought years. Contact your county Extension office for more information. b) Sell non-essential animals. The money received can help buy additional feed for remaining animals. Plant alternative crops for forage. A number of crops, including 70-day corn, buckwheat and millet, may be planted mid-summer to offset early losses. (See the fact sheet “Alternative Crops During a Drought.”) Talk about it. Drought can bring feelings of great anger, frustration and hopelessness to farmers, especially for those already experiencing tough financial times. It\\'s critical that producers talk about the stress they are feeling, rather than isolating themselves from family or neighbors. In some cases, intervention may be needed to connect farmers with counselors, clergy members or other professionals. (See the fact sheet “Identifying Stress in Family and Others.”) Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Tillage During a Drought WHAT TO DO — AND NOT TO DO — WHEN SOILS ARE DRY The best advice on tillage during a drought may be: avoid it. When soils are dry, you should do everything you can to conserve remaining moisture. This may mean holding off on plowing, disking and cultivating so as not to disturb soils and let moisture escape in the process. Keep in mind that any operation that brings soil up to the surface may worsen conditions. The guidelines at right offer some general considerations. For advice specific to your crops and drought conditions, contact your county Extension agent. Additional resources: Your county agricultural agent Related publications: UW-Extension publications– “Planting for Conservation Tillage,” (A3396); “Row Crop Cultivators,” (A3483); “Optimum Corn Planting Practices,” (A3264); “Conservation Tillage for Corn,” (A3091); “Making Conservation Tillage Work for Corn Production on Your Soil Type,” (A3386); “Managing Drought-Stressed Corn and Soybeans,” (NCR238). GENERAL GUIDELINES Minimum tillage. Try to use minimum tillage techniques if possible. These will leave crop residue from the preceding year on the surface, thereby reducing evaporation of moisture from the soil. Conservation tillage may be a particularly good method because it leaves more than 30 percent of the residues, such as old cornstalks, in fields after planting. Weed control. Use chemical weed control, rather than tillage, to manage weeds. With chemical weed control, you avoid disturbing the soil and causing moisture loss. Planting. While it helps to plant in the moist soil below the dry surface, don\\'t plant beyond the maximum recommended depth for your crop. Tilling. If you must till, keep it at a shallow level. For example, when field cultivating, use a depth of 2 to 3 inches, rather than 4 to 5. Do not subsoil. Chisel plowing. If using a chisel plow, use sweeps instead of twisted shovels on it. The sweeps bring up less soil, while leaving more crop residue on the soil surface. As a result, less moisture is lost from the soil. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension DROUGHT-FARM DROUGHT Irrigation During a Drought CONSIDERATIONS FOR NON-IRRIGATING FARMERS Drought conditions are great anxiety producers, especially if you don\\'t normally irrigate your crops. As painful as it may be, however, the best advice for non-irrigators is often to wait things out during a drought. While some irrigation equipment may be available on an emergency basis from dealers or area irrigators, the permitting process for surface water or groundwater sources can take well over a month. Furthermore, the manpower, training, and financing needed to develop an irrigation system make it unrealistic as a short-term solution. Running an irrigation system can be a full-time job in itself, one that can take three years to master, and one that may take ten years to pay off through increased production. One thing you can do is realistically evaluate whether an irrigation system makes sense for you in the the long run. Follow the guidelines at right to make this determination and to understand the processes involved in setting up an irrigation system. DO SOME RESEARCH Consider irrigation in relation to your type of crops, soil, water availability, time and farm budget. Irrigation systems have become increasingly sophisticated—something that makes them more valuable in terms of productivity, but also more of a commitment in terms of time, management and financial investment. Discuss the matter with your county Extension office, other irrigators and equipment dealers. Collect information on your soils and local climatic conditions. If you have a sandy soil with lower water-holding capacity, for instance, an irrigation system can make a significant difference in crop yields. You can get a county soils report from the local USDA Soil Conservation Service office, county Extension office or Land Conservation department. Examine the types of crops you currently grow for root depth and therefore, water needs. You want to be sure that irrigation equipment costs will be offset by an increase in yields or quality of crop. You should also consider the possibility of growing higher value crops (using irrigation) such as potatoes, strawberries, sweet corn, dry beans, snap beans, cucumbers, potatoes and carrots. Are they realistic for your soil type and climatic conditions? Consider water sources. Contact the Wisconsin Geological and Natural History Survey for information about groundwater sources for your area. See the section below for guidelines regarding surface water. Talk to irrigation equipment dealers about irrigation systems and what might be appropriate for your current or future needs. Topography and field size are two of many factors affecting system needs. Consider the economics of irrigation. Discuss potential yields with other area irrigators as well as your Extension agent. In general, irrigation may more than double yields in a field, and pay for itself within 10 years. Increases may be 75-80 bushels of corn per acre and four tons more alfalfa per acre. However, success with irrigation varies depending upon soils, weather, climate, type of irrigation, etc. Assess your current economic conditions. Talk to your lenders. Irrigation may not be a good idea right now because of the financial burden. However, it may be something to plan for in the future.

SURFACE WATER AS AN IRRIGATION SOURCE Surface water diversions generally cover rivers, lakes and streams. Riparian land—land which adjoins these waterways—is the first requirement for irrigators. In order to obtain a surface water diversion permit from the DNR, you also will need: A legal description of the land to be irrigated, such as NE1/4 of SE1/4 of Sec. 23, T14N, R10E. A waiver from downstream irrigators, hydropower dams, municipal or industrial waste dischargers. A “chain of title” test (an abstract examined by an attorney), which determines the acreage of riparian land. The proposed diversion, including the maximum pumping rate of the diversion, the maximum acreage to be irrigated (tillable acres), the type of crop, inches of water per irrigation, maximum number of irrigations anticipated per growing season, start and end dates of irrigation per growing season. GROUNDWATER AS AN IRRIGATION SOURCE Groundwater diversions are covered by DNR high-capacity well permits. These wells pump 70 gallons per minute (gpm) or more. Contact a local well driller of the DNR District water manager to initiate the permitting process. For a well permit, you will need: General information on water needs, property ownerships, location and operator. Design information, including a well driller\\'s report and pump information. A DNR site inspection for local contamination. IRRIGATION EQUIPMENT Irrigation equipment dealers can be very helpful in assessing your needs and potential for irrigation. Equipment ranges from large-volume traveling sprinklers which can cover 100 acres in a week to center pivots which water up to 133 acres in two days. The supply of equipment is somewhat limited during the growing season. Most equipment is sold and delivered during the winter and early spring. Keep this in mind as you begin irrigation system planning. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Fertilizer Application After a Drought CONSIDERATIONS FOR THIS YEAR AND NEXT Generally, fertilizer application is not much of an issue during a drought year. Fertilizers often have been applied before the true extent of a drought is known. If they haven\\'t already been applied, you need to adjust rates based on lowered yield expectancy for the drought year. If little or no production is likely, it may be best to skip an application. Fertilizer use does become a significant issue the year after a drought, however. Low crop yields during the drought year mean that significant amounts of unused nutrients could remain in the soil at the end of the growing season. Where nutrient carryover is substantial, fertilizer needs for the following year are likely to be affected. Several methods are available to help growers determine nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium carryover and current needs. PHOSPHOROUS AND POTASSIUM CARRYOVER If phosphorous or potassium was applied but not used because of lower than expected yields, it usually remains in the top few inches of soil. It will not be lost over the winter. Therefore, the unused portion can be credited against nutrient needs for next year\\'s crops. A formula for determining carryover. One method for estimating unused phosphorous and potassium is based on the ratio of the actual drought-year yield and the yield goal used to determine nutrient applications that year. For example: Drought year application = 75 lb./acre phosphate = 300 lb./acre potash Drought year yield goal = 6 tons/acre (alfalfa) Actual yield = 2 tons/acre Actual yield/yield goal = 2/6 = 1/3 Therefore, 2/3 of drought-year application is unused Estimated carryover = 2/3 x 75 lb./acre = 50 lb./acre phosphate = 2/3 x 300 lb./acre = 200 lb./acre potash Comparison of the actual yield with the expected yield shows that the drought-year yields were 1/3 of the goal. Under the assumption that nutrient removal is proportional to yield, approximately 2/3 of the phosphate and potash applied in the drought year was not used and likely will be available to the next crop. Soil tests. Routine soil tests also can be used to determine the current levels of available phosphate and potash, and to obtain fertilizer recommendations. They are useful for detecting carryover where relatively large amounts of nutrients were applied in the drought year, such as in topdress maintenance fertilizer programs for alfalfa. Relatively small amounts of carryover, such as those that could occur following application in a maintenance program for corn, might not be detected. The tests may be done in spring or fall. NITROGEN CARRYOVER Following a drought year, most nitrogen carryover exists as nitrate in the plant root zone. However, the possibility of overwinter loss of residual nitrate makes estimation of carryover more difficult than for phosphorous University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension DROUGHT-FARM DROUGHT more information SOIL TESTING LABS Soil testing and analysis are available from the University of Wisconsin soil testing labs in Madison and Marshfield, and other private soil testing labs. Your county Extension office can provide names and locations of commercial labs performing these tests in your area, as well as more specific sampling instructions and forms.

The amount of residual nitrogen in the soil at the end of the growing season must be considered, as well as factors affecting overwinter loss. Specifically, nitrogen carryover is likely where: The drought-year crop was corn or a non-legume. The crop received moderate to high amounts of nitrogen as fertilizer or as legume or manure nitrogen credits. Yields were below expected levels. Soils are silt loam or heavier-textured. Overwinter precipitation amounts are normal or below normal. TESTING FOR NITROGEN CARRYOVER A preplant soil nitrate test should be used to determine how much nitrate has remained in the soil until the next growing season. Sample in the spring. Soil samples should be collected in the spring after the frost has left your fields and before preplant applications of nitrogen fertilizer. Collection methods. a) Take at least 15 random soil cores from uniform soil areas no larger than 20 acres. b) Take separate samples from areas with soil or management practice differences. c) Sample in 1-foot increments to a depth of 2 feet. d) Each sample should be placed in a clean container marked for the appropriate depth. e) Thoroughly mix the soil from each depth and collect a 1-cup subsample. This sample should be sent to a soil testing lab for analysis. Air dry or freeze samples. Do not store or send composite samples to the lab in moist condition. If samples can\\'t be taken to the soil testing lab within one day after collection, they should be air-dried (by spreading on clean paper for 24 to 48 hours) as soon as possible. Another option is to freeze your samples immediately after collection and then either transport them to the testing lab while still frozen or air-dry the samples before shipment. Provide background information. The soil testing lab needs to know if you applied manure to your sampled fields or if the previous crop was a legume. Provide the soil name. The name of the predominant soil and its organic matter content within the sampled area is needed. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Weed Management During a Drought HERBICIDE EFFECTIVENESS AND MECHANICAL MEASURES Dry weather after planting causes many concerns, including the impact of weeds on annual crops. Many herbicides lose effectiveness during dry periods; growers who use herbicides on corn and soybean crops are likely to be affected. Fortunately, an awareness of herbicide effectiveness and the aggressive use of mechanical weed control measures can make a difference. SOIL-APPLIED HERBICIDES Preplant incorporated herbicides. These are applied before planting and mixed into the soil. They work best when: a) the product is mixed uniformly with soil to the depth recommended by the manufacturer; b) soils have reasonable moisture levels after incorporation has been completed. If the soil is only slightly dry, incorporated herbicides generally perform adequately. Seldom is it so dry early in the season that incorporated treatments fail. In a true drought, however, they may not give acceptable weed control. Therefore, be prepared to cultivate if weeds appear. Pre-emergence herbicides. These depend totally upon rainfall after applications to “activate” the product. Rainfall positions the chemical in the upper soil surface where the weed seeds germinate; there is no chemical change as perhaps the term “activate” suggests. To obtain adequate herbicide activity, however, rain must fall within 10 to 14 days after the seedbed was prepared. Without such precipitation, pre-emergence herbicides generally fail to give acceptable weed control even if a true drought does not develop. Therefore, mechanical weed control may become critical within weeks of planting. Two examples: a) If a field is prepared to plant on April 30, corn is planted on May 1 and a pre-emergence herbicide is applied on May 2, rainfall of at least one-quarter to one-half inches is needed within 10 to 14 days to assure adequate performance. If rainfall does not occur by May 12, the grower should begin rotary hoeing. b) If a field is prepared on April 30 and corn is planted on May 10, followed by pre-emergence herbicide on May 11, plan to rotary hoe on May 12 unless rainfall is very likely in the immediate future. As illustrated above, when planting and spraying are close to the field preparation time (example a), there is more time to get the needed rainfall to make a surface-applied herbicide perform adequately. As time between field preparation and spraying increases (example b), there are fewer days after an application to get a timely rain. Thus, rotary hoeing becomes necessary sooner. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension DROUGHT-FARM DROUGHT more information Additional resources: Your county agricultural agent Related publications: UW-Extension publication “Reduced Herbicide Rates: Aspects to Consider,” (A3563). ROTARY HOEING Rotary hoeing kills weeds that have germinated but have not yet emerged. These weeds are in the “white root” stage of development. After weeds emerge, rotary hoeing is less effective. Rotary hoeing also helps place the herbicide in the upper soil surface so that when rains do fall, the herbicide is in a better position to be quickly taken up by weed seedlings and hopefully kill them. If it has not rained within seven days of the first rotary hoeing, make a second pass with the rotary hoe to kill the next generation of weeds. POST-EMERGENCE HERBICIDES Post-emergence herbicides also may fail in dry weather. These treatments work best when weeds are actively growing. When weeds are stressed by lack of adequate soil moisture, chemical control declines. If you decide to apply post-emergence herbicides under very dry conditions, be aware that crop injury may occur and weed control will be poor. CULTIVATION In all situations, be prepared to cultivate once or twice following rotary hoeing. Some growers mistakenly believe that soil loses more moisture when cultivated. But remember that weeds transpire water into the atmosphere every day they are in the field; the longer weeds live, the more soil moisture is lost and unavailable for the crop, and the harder they are to eradicate. So it is always a wise decision to cultivate weeds early on. Cultivate when the weeds are relatively small and the crop is large enough (at least 4 inches tall) to allow you to roll some soil into the row without covering the crop. The crop should be at least three times as tall as the weeds when the first cultivation is done (for example, the crop is 6 inches tall and the weeds are 2 inches or less tall). This way, the weeds in the row can be covered with minimal effect on the crop. The cultivator need not be set any deeper than a couple of inches to dislodge the weeds; little if any moist soil will be brought to the surface. A second cultivation can be done when the crop is 14 to 18 inches tall. This requires timely mechanical practices, but keep in mind that in drought years, a few uncontrolled weeds cost more in reduced yield than in years with ample moisture. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Alternative Crops During a Drought MEETING FORAGE AND GRAIN NEEDS IN AN EMERGENCY Alternative crops can be a major concern during a drought. If planting was postponed or plants didn\\'t survive because of drought, mid-summer planting may be necessary for adequate forage or grain. You also may be concerned about feed supplies for next year and, therefore, wish to plant additional crops this fall. Unfortunately, no one can predict the longevity of a drought. But you do have options, and the knowledge that planning ahead is always a good idea. ALTERNATIVE FORAGES FOR THIS YEAR Before giving up on existing crops, examine your current crops for silage potential. Corn, for example, may be the best forage alternative available. Also, keep in mind the added labor and cost of establishing alternative crops. Unfortunately, there is no guarantee regarding yield or quality of alternative forages. Existing crops as alternative forages. Test these forages and use the data to obtain efficient use through balanced rations: a) alfalfa, red clover, trefoil b) corn and soybeans c) peas or canning crops d) small grains e) grasses Summer-seeded crops. These generally should be seeded by July 15 and only if moisture is available for germination and emergence. Crops include: a) sudan, sorghum-sudan and forage sorghum b) hybrid pearl millet c) soybeans (alone or mixed with sorghum-sudan) d) 70-day corn e) brassicas - forage rape, turnips f) millets - common, German, foxtail or Japanese g) buckwheat h) winter grain with field peas. These should be planted from mid- to late-August. Alternative cash crops. If you planted cash crops such as wheat or corn, but drought is causing problems, you may decide to replant. Some good alternatives are buckwheat and millet, which can be planted in July. These are very short season crops and both are high in fiber. Consider whether you have a market to sell these two crops or whether you can feed them to livestock. MEETING DEMANDS FOR NEXT YEAR Spring grains. If moisture is available for germination and emergence, you can plant spring grains like wheat, oats or barley in August. These can be harvested until a hard freeze, which usually occurs in late October. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension DROUGHT-FARM DROUGHT more information Additional resources: Your county agricultural agent Winter rye and winter wheat. For the earliest harvest of forage next spring, plant winter rye in September. It can be harvested mid-May. Another alternative is winter wheat, which has a higher forage yield but must be harvested seven to ten days later. REDUCING THE RISK OF DROUGHT STRESS The only sure method to avoid drought-stressed crops is to use irrigation. Other management practices, however, can help reduce the risk of drought stress. Early planting. By planting early, you increase the chance of having pollination completed before the driest part of the season. Optimum fertilization. Proper fertilization will promote healthy plant growth and efficient moisture utilization, essential for high yields in both normal and dry years. Adequate weed control. Weeds compete with crop plants for water, so controlling weeds will provide more water for the crop. Residue management. By maintaining a cover of residue through conservation tillage or no-till, you can reduce the amount of evaporation from the soil surface and conserve water for the crop\\'s use. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Purdue University Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Salvaging Drought-Stressed Crops ANALYZING NUTRITIONAL VALUE AND SAFETY Drought-stressed crops may often be salvaged, but testing for nutritional value and harmful substances is extremely important. Nitrate toxicity and aflatoxins may be a problem in drought years. Depending on test results, feed amounts need to be adjusted for animal nutrition and safety. Additional resources: Your county agricultural agent Related publications: UW-Extension publications– “Managing Drought-Stressed Corn and Soybeans,” (NCR238); “Protect Livestock From Nitrate Poisoning,” (A1889); “Feeding the Dairy Herd,” (NCR346). FRESH FORAGE Versus SILAGE If plants show signs of drought stress, be careful about using them as fresh forage because nitrate levels may be high. A better option is to use plants as silage, because the silage fermentation process reduces nitrate levels. In either case, testing is critical for safe feeding. Symptoms of nitrate poisoning in livestock include labored breathing, frothing at the mouth and a brownish color of the nonpigmented skin within a few hours after feeding. Abortions can occur; death may occur within an hour in extreme cases. Silage should be stored at least three weeks before testing and feeding take place. Testing is available from private companies and state universities. Contact your county Extension agent for a list of laboratories. Have both a nutritional analysis and nitrate test completed on crops. Results will take longer for nitrate tests. Test results will help you determine safe feeding amounts, as well as the need for grain and protein supplements. OATS, BARLEY AND CORN Test drought-stressed oats and barley for nutritional value. They often are reduced to empty hulls or a very light grain. The result is low energy and protein and a limited feeding value for poultry and swine. Oats and barley may work well in combination with beef and other livestock feeds. Consult with your livestock nutritionist or agricultural agent about corn use. Corn quality usually is not a concern during drought; corn kernels may be smaller, but feeding value is not affected to the same degree as for oats and barley. Ear corn, however, may be lower in nutritional value due to a higher cob to kernel ratio. Test for aflatoxins in grain fields. The fungus, Asperilla flavus, and certain other molds may produce toxic substances in the field and in storage. They historically have been a problem in southern states where severe drought and high temperatures more commonly are experienced. Contact your county agricultural agent for a list of qualified laboratories. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension DROUGHT-FARM DROUGHT Herbicide Concerns After a Drought ACCOUNTING FOR CARRYOVER IN NEXT YEAR\\'S CROPS When soils are moist during the growing season, herbicides break down through microbial and chemical processes. These reactions may be slowed greatly in drought conditions. If herbicide residues are significant, they may injure rotational crops in the following season. For this reason, growers need to be aware of herbicide residues and take steps to decrease risk of injury. HERBICIDE CARRYOVER LEVELS Herbicides vary greatly in soil persistence and carryover to next year\\'s crops. Essentially no risk. Herbicides presenting essentially no risk of carryover for next year\\'s crops include: 2, 4-D, Roundup, Gramoxone, Basagran, Poast, Assure, Fusilade, Sutan, Select, Banvel, Clarity, Blazer, Eptam, Eradicane, Lorox, Buctril, Reflex, Cobra, Butyrac, and MCPA. Moderate risk. Herbicides presenting a moderate risk of carryover to next year\\'s crops include: Sencor, Lexone, Bladex, Treflan, Prowl, Accent, Beacon, Broadstrike, Velpar, Balan, Stinger, Classic, Pinnacle, Lasso, Dual, Frontier, Surpass and Harness. High risk. Herbicides presenting a high risk of carryover to next year\\'s crops include: atrazine, Pursuit, Scepter, Command and Princep. AVOIDING RESIDUE PROBLEMS Check the label of herbicides used during the drought season. It will tell you the normal interval between application and planting for a specific rotational crop. Footnotes frequently show if the risk of carryover is greater under certain conditions (such as soil pH or dry soils). Select this year\\'s herbicides carefully. Do not choose herbicides or use rates that have significant injury potential by themselves. Do not use products that may interact with carryover levels of last year\\'s products. For example, do not use metribuzin (Sencor, Lexone) in soybeans this year if atrazine was used in corn planted during the drought year. Use tillage. Tillage will dilute the herbicide, especially if it is concentrated near the surface or in bands over the row. Look for herbicide tolerance. Select crop varieties or hybrids with greater tolerance to the herbicide used during the drought year. This information is not available for all varieties. Ask your seed supplier for assistance. Use good management practices. Good seedbeds, proper seeding depth and rate, adequate soil fertility, and insect and disease protection will minimize the effect of herbicide carryover. Many crops can tolerate a single stress relatively well, but two or more stresses can result in significant loss of crop vigor and yield.

TESTING FOR CARRYOVER If you choose to test for herbicide carryover, the best time to do so is between late October and mid-November for most of Wisconsin. By this time, soil temperatures reach and remain below 50 degrees F., a point at which herbicide breakdown is minimal. Do not take soil samples for residues before this time; they may indicate levels greater than actually present when you plant next year. A bioassay test may be helpful if doubts remain about planting because of possible herbicide residues. The test will alert you to residue problems by comparing the productivity of your intended crop variety in both affected and unaffected soils. (Follow the guidelines in the UW-Extension publication “A Simple Test for Atrazine Residues.”) Begin the test at least three weeks prior to planting so that sufficient plant growth is available to assess carryover potential. The herbicide label may also contain suggestions on running a bioassay test, as well as information on crop rotations and carryover potential. A chemical test for herbicide residues can also be done by private laboratories. These tests are expensive and the results may not be easy to interpret. However, they may be appropriate in cases where bioassays cannot be done or where high value crops are concerned. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Drought Assistance for Farmers SOURCES OF GRANTS, LOANS AND OTHER ASSISTANCE When drought conditions take their toll on farmers, government programs and lenders can make the difference. Some, such as the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, offer feed-grain programs, while others offer grants and loans. While there admittedly will be some paperwork involved, your efforts will pay off with higher benefits if you apply for a variety of programs early on. Your county Extension office can help determine programs for which you are most qualified. As for your local lenders, start negotiating about potential needs—such as money to buy feed—before drought conditions peak. That way you are not managing in a panic mode and neither are lenders.

The good news is that come tax time, you have some options that might make things easier. If you have received federal disaster payments, you may be able to postpone reporting them on your income taxes for a year. Likewise, if you were forced to sell livestock because of the drought, you may be able to postpone reporting gains on the sale for as long as two years afterward. Here are some basic things you need to know. But for the best advice for your situation, see a tax practitioner knowledgeable about farm tax laws and assistance programs. CROP INSURANCE PROCEEDS AND DISASTER PAYMENTS If you are a cash method farmer, you are allowed to postpone reporting insurance and disaster payments on crop losses by one year under Section 451(d) of the tax code. Generally, this rule applies when crops cannot be planted or are damaged or destroyed by a natural disaster such as a drought or a flood. It applies to all insurance proceeds and to federal payments received for losses due to a natural disaster. Qualifying for the election. You must be able to show that under your normal business practice, the income from the crop would have been reported in the year following receipt of payment for it. Two options for reporting on tax returns. If you qualify for the exception, you have the option of reporting the payments as income in the year it is received or as income in the following year. Electing to postpone reporting the payment as income covers all crops from a farm. You must file a separate election for each farming business you operate. Separate businesses are defined as those for which you keep separate books and are allowed to use different methods of accounting. HOW TO MAKE THE ELECTION The election must be attached to the return (or amended return) for the tax year in which the payment was received. The statement must include: Your name and address. A declaration that you are making an election under Section 451(d). Identification of the specific crop or crops destroyed or damaged. A declaration that under your normal business practice, the income from the damaged crops would have been included in your gross income for the tax year following the damage. The cause of damage of crops and the dates on which the damage occurred. The total amount of payments received from insurance carriers, itemized with respect to each specific crop and with respect to the date each payment was received. The names of insurance carriers from whom payments were received. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension DROUGHT-FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE more information THE LIVESTOCK ELECTION The election to either roll over the gain or defer it to next year is fairly simple. It is made by not reporting the deferred gain on the tax return and by attaching a statement showing all the details of the involuntary conversion including: Evidence of existence of the drought conditions that forced the sale or exchange of the livestock. A computation of the amount of gain realized on the sale or exchange. The number and kind of livestock sold or exchanged. The number of livestock of each kind that would have been sold or exchanged under the usual business practice in the absence of the drought. Additional resources: Your county Extension office; the Internal Revenue Service, (800) 829-3676, for forms; your local emergency government office; income tax preparers Related publications: UW-Extension publication, “Income Tax Management for Farmers,” (NCR002). IRS Publication 225, “Farmers Tax Guide;” IRS Publication 334, “Tax Guide for Small Business;” IRS Publication 547, “Nonbusiness Disasters, Casualties and Thefts.” LIVESTOCK SALES There are two tax provisions that apply to the sale of livestock because of drought. One allows the taxpayer to roll the gain into the basis of replacement livestock. The other allows the taxpayer to defer reporting the income by one year. ROLLING GAIN INTO REPLACEMENT LIVESTOCK If livestock are sold because of drought conditions, the gain realized on the sale does not have to be reported if the proceeds are used to purchase replacement livestock within two years of the end of the tax year of the sale. This applies to livestock (other than poultry) held for any length of time for draft, breeding or dairy (no sporting) purposes. The new livestock must be used for the same purpose as the livestock that were sold. Therefore, dairy cows must be replaced with dairy cows. The taxpayer must show that the drought caused the sale of more livestock than would have been sold without the drought conditions. The farmer has a basis in the replacement livestock equal to the basis in the livestock sold, plus an amount invested in the replacement livestock that exceeds the proceeds from the sale. In this case, there is no requirement that the drought conditions cause an area to be declared a disaster area by the federal government. DEFERRING INCOME TO NEXT YEAR If any livestock are sold because of drought conditions, you may be eligible for another exception to the general rule that the sale proceeds must be reported in the year they are received. This election applies to all livestock. This exception allows the taxpayer to postpone reporting the income by one year. To qualify, the taxpayer must show that the livestock would normally have been sold in a subsequent year. Additionally, the sale of the livestock must have been prompted by a drought that caused an area to be declared a federal disaster area. It is not necessary that the livestock be raised or sold in the declared disaster area. The sale can take place before or after an area is declared a disaster area as long as the same disaster caused the sale. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension t o r n a d o e s Tornado Preparedness and Response STRATEGIES FOR FAMILIES Tornadoes are common in Wisconsin and worth taking seriously. The most violent tornadoes are capable of tremendous destruction with wind speeds of 250 miles per hour or more. Damage paths can be in excess of a mile wide and 50 miles long. When a tornado is coming, you have only a short amount of time to make life-or-death decisions. Advance planning and quick response are the keys to surviving a tornado. A tornado is defined as a violently rotating column of air extending from a thunderstorm to the ground. It usually forms when weather is warm, humid and unsettled, and often in conjunction with severe thunderstorms. Direction of movement usually is from the southwest to the northeast, but a tornado\\'s path may be erratic. Likewise, tornadoes tend to occur between 3 and 8 p.m., but they may occur any time. BE PREPARED Conduct tornado drills each tornado season. Designate an area in your home as a shelter and practice having everyone in the family go there in response to a tornado threat. A basement, storm cellar or lowest level of your home is best. If there is no basement, use an inner hallway or a small inner room without a window, such as a bathroom or a closet. If you live in a mobile home, plan to take shelter in another building with a strong foundation. Some mobile home parks provide shelter for residents. If your park does not have a community shelter, consult with the management and request that one be provided. Know the difference between a “tornado watch” and a “tornado warning.” a) A tornado watch is issued by the National Weather Service when weather conditions are such that tornadoes are likely to develop. When a watch is announced, you should listen to the radio or television for further developments; keep a battery-powered radio on hand in case electrical power is lost; and tie down loose objects outside or bring them inside. b) A tornado warning is issued when a tornado has been sighted or indicated by radar. At this point, the danger is very serious and everyone should go to a safe place, turn on a battery-operated radio or television and wait for the “all clear” by the authorities. Have emergency supplies on hand. a) Flashlights and extra batteries b) Portable battery-operated radio and extra batteries c) First-aid kit and manual; essential medicines d) Emergency food, water, cooking equipment, can opener e) Cash and credit cards f) Sturdy shoes Develop an emergency communication plan. In case family members are separated during a disaster because of work or school, choose a long-distance relative or friend to serve as the “family contact.” After a disaster, it is often easier to call long-distance than to make a local call. Make sure everyone in the family knows the name, address and phone number of the contact person. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension TORNADOES-PREPARATION more information AFTER A TORNADO Gas leaks. If you smell the putrid odor of leaking gas, leave your home immediately and call the gas company. Lanterns, torches, electrical sparks and cigarettes could cause an explosive fire if there is a leak. Do not turn on any light switches. Electrocution. Check utility lines and appliances for damage. If electrical wiring appears damaged, turn off the current at the main fuse box or circuit breaker. Structural damage. Watch for falling debris and the possibility of collapse. Water. If water pipes are damaged, do not use water from the tap; it may be contaminated. Damaged sewage systems should be serviced as soon as possible — they are health hazards.

DURING A TORNADO If you are at home during a tornado: Go at once to the basement, storm cellar or the lowest level of the building. If there is no basement, go to an inner hallway or a small inner room without a window, such as a bathroom or a closet. Get away from windows. Go to the center of the room. Stay away from corners because they tend to attract debris. Get under a piece of sturdy furniture such as a workbench or heavy table. Use your arms to protect your head and neck. If at work or school: Go to the basement or to an inside hallway at the lowest level. Avoid wide rooms such as auditoriums, cafeterias or large hallways. Get under a piece of sturdy furniture such as a workbench, heavy table or desk. Use your arms to protect your head and neck. If outdoors: If possible, get inside a building. If shelter is not available or there is no time to get indoors, lie in a ditch or low-lying area or crouch near a strong building. Use your arms to protect your head and neck. If in a car or truck: Never try to outdrive a tornado. Tornadoes can change direction quickly and can lift up a car or truck and toss it through the air. Get out of the car immediately and take shelter in a nearby building, ditch or low-lying area away from the vehicle. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Wisconsin Division of Emergency Government University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Protecting Homes From Lightning WHAT TO DO BEFORE LIGHTNING STRIKES Three protective measures will help safeguard your home from lightning: a lightning-rod and ground system, a grounded TV antenna and grounded appliances. These devices are particularly important if you live in an area subject to frequent or severe thunderstorms. Unless you have the expertise, have only licensed electrical contractors install these systems. LIGHTNING-ROD SYSTEMS Lightning-rod and ground systems, if properly installed, are believed to be at least 90 percent effective in preventing damage should a lightning strike occur. They were more common years ago, when they were sold door to door with high pressure tactics. Today, fewer homes have such systems, perhaps because people feel the $1,500-plus cost outweighs the risk. Just what is the risk? One estimate says a Wisconsin home is likely to be struck by lightning once every 350 years. A good lightning protection system has five components: The lightning rod or air terminal intended to intercept the strike. Some metal roofs can be used as air terminals. A cable capable of conducting the electrical charge safely to the ground. The ground connector, which provides contact with the earth so that the lightning can be safely dissipated. The bonding between the first three components so that no side flash occurs at the joints because of a poor connection. The lightning arrester or surge protector. Arresters guard against damage that may occur from lightning that strikes a nearby power line, phone line or other wire entering the house. Quality components and proper installation are both important. If you are purchasing a system be sure it has been approved by the Lightning Protection Institute or Underwriters Laboratory. Also be sure that the contractor is listed or certified by one or both of these groups. GROUNDED TV ANTENNAS Even if you have a lightning rod system, outdoor television antennas should be grounded. The “core of protection” created by a grounded high point probably extends downward at a 45-degree angle all around the high point. A grounded antenna is no substitute for a lightning-rod system, however. If you have a lightning-rod and ground system, the TV can be grounded by connecting the mast to the rod system. The ribbon lead-in should run through the arrester; the arrester should be grounded to one of the lightning-rod grounds. The arrester should be located at a lower level (closer to the earth) than the TV set. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension TORNADOES-PREPARATION more information Additional resources: Your county Extension office, your electric power supplier, licensed electrical contractors, the Lightning Protection Institute GROUNDED APPLIANCES Appliances are more frequently burned out by electrical surges from nearby lightning strikes than from direct lightning. Lightning does not have to strike the distribution line to cause such a surge. To protect appliances, have a “secondary lightning arrester” installed in the service wires at the point where they drop to the house. Your electric power supplier can tell you where to purchase these secondary arresters and what kinds would be best for your electrical system. SURGE PROTECTORS A relatively inexpensive way to protect electronic equipment from power surges is though use of surge protectors. These devices are typically attached between the appliance and the wall outlet. They protect delicate electronic components in appliances such as microwave ovens, computers and VCRs from power surges caused by lightning or other sources. You can purchase surge protectors at computer and office-equipment stores. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Standby Electric Generators A SOURCE OF EMERGENCY POWER FOR FARMERS An emergency source of power is important for any farm with mechanically ventilated production facilities, bulk milk handling equipment, mechanical feeding equipment or facilities requiring constant and continuous heat (such as brooders). On such a farm, a standby electric generator is a good investment, possibly preventing costly losses during a power failure. During disasters such as flood or tornado, relief agencies may provide generators to farmers on an emergency basis. TYPES OF GENERATORS Standby generators are either engine driven or tractor driven. Either type can be stationary or portable. Engine driven units can be either manual or automatic start. Gasoline-, LP gas- (bottled gas) and diesel-fueled engines are available. Generators must provide the same type of power at the same voltage and frequency as that supplied by power lines. This is usually 120/240 volt, single phase, 60 cycle alternating current (AC). An air-cooled engine is often used for generators up to 15 kilowatts. A liquid-cooled engine is necessary for generators larger than 15 kilowatts. Engine capacity of 2 to 2 1/4 hp with the proper drive system must be available for each 1,000 watts of generator output. SIZE OF GENERATORS A full-load system will handle the entire farmstead load. Automatic engine-powered, full-load systems will begin to furnish power immediately, or up to 30 seconds after power is off. Smaller and less expensive part-load systems may be enough to handle essential equipment during an emergency. Power-take-off (PTO) generators are about half as costly as engine-operated units. Under a part-load system, only the most essential equipment is operated at one time. For most farms, this type of system is adequate, provided the generator is sized to start the largest motor. For example, the milk cooler or ventilation fan would need to be operated continuously, but the operation of the silo unloader and mechanical feeding system could be postponed until the milking chores are completed. PTO units can be mounted on a trailer. INSTALLATION Wiring and equipment must be installed in accordance with the National Electrical Code, local ordinances and the requirements of your power supplier. It is essential that you have the proper equipment for disconnecting the generator from public utility lines. Most companies require the installation of a double-pole double-throw transfer switch or its equivalent for this purpose. Check with your electrician or power supply representative for installation, installation instructions and inspection.

LOCATION AND SAFETY FEATURES Large engine generators should be located in a building, preferably a heated building. Inlet and outlet air ducts must be large enough to carry off excess heat. They should be open at least a half a square foot for each 1,000 watts of generator capacity. Combustion fumes must be carried outdoors safely. Exhaust pipes must be at least 6 inches from combustible material. OPERATION An automatic standby unit should start automatically when power fails, and stop when power is restored. When using an engine-driven generator with a manual start, or when using a tractor driven unit, follow this procedure when power fails: Call your power supplier and advise them of the conditions. Turn off or disconnect all electrical equipment. Position the tractor or engine for belt of PTO drive. Start the unit and bring the generator up to proper speed (1,800 or 3,600 rps). Check on arrangement to carry off exhaust fumes. Be sure there is no danger of fire. The voltmeter will indicate when the generator is ready to carry the load. Put the transfer switch in the generator position. Start the largest electrical motor first, adding other loads when each is up to operating speed. Do not add too much too fast. If the generator cuts out for any reason, repeat the second, third and fourth steps above. Check the voltmeter frequently. If voltage falls below 200 volts for 240 volt service or below 100 volts for 120 volt service, reduce the load on the generator by turning off some electrical equipment. When commercial power is restored, put the transfer switch in normal power position. Then stop the standby unit. MAINTENANCE Keep the unit clean and in good running order at all times so it will be ready for immediate use. Dust and dirt accumulations on the motor can cause it to overheat when operated. Follow maintenance instructions in manufacturer\\'s manual. A short operation at set intervals will keep the engine in good operating condition. Regularly scheduled warm-ups are necessary to keep a standby engine in working order. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Salvaging Food After a Tornado FOOD SAFETY IN THE EYE OF A DISASTER Damaged food supplies, water contamination and temporary loss of refrigeration may be critical issues for you as a tornado survivor. While structural damage may be the initial focus in your home, some basic precautions can keep your food stores safe and your family healthy as you begin clean-up efforts. If you live in an area susceptible to tornadoes, keep an adequate supply of food, bottled water and emergency equipment on hand. This includes enough canned food to last four to five days, a hand can opener, battery-powered radio, extra batteries and emergency cooking equipment like a camp stove with fuel to operate it.

USE CAUTION WITH WATER AND FOOD SUPPLIES The water supply may be disrupted or contaminated after an area has sustained a tornado. Food in damaged buildings and homes may be hazardous. Follow these precautions: Drink only approved or chlorinated water. Consider all water from wells, cisterns and other delivery systems in the disaster area unsafe until tested. Check foods and discard any containing particles of glass or slivers of other debris. Discard canned foods with broken seams. REFRIGERATION AND FREEZER CONCERNS If the electricity is off to the refrigerator or freezer, follow these guidelines: Discard refrigerated meats, seafood, milk, soft cheese, eggs, prepared foods and cookie doughs if they have been kept above 40 degrees F. for over two hours. Also discard thawed items that have warmed above 40 degrees F., with the exception of breads and plain cakes. Discard any refrigerated items that turn moldy or have an unusual odor or appearance. Refreeze partially or completely frozen foods. Cold but fully thawed, uncooked meat, fish or poultry should be checked for off-odor. If there is none, cook and eat or cook and refreeze. Discard combination dishes such as stews, casseroles and meat pies if they are thawed. Refreeze thawed (but cold) juices, baked goods, and dairy items such as cream, cheese and butter. Do not refreeze thawed vegetables unless ice crystals remain. Cook and use them if there are no off-odors.

University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension TORNADO-CLEAN-UP/REPAIR Disinfecting Dishes, Cookware and Utensils SAFETY GUIDELINES AFTER A DISASTER During a disaster such as a flood, tornado or fire, kitchen items easily can become contaminated. Floodwaters may contain silt, raw sewage, oil or chemical wastes, while fires may leave residues from toxic fumes or fire-fighting chemicals. Before using any item that has come in contact with these substances, follow the guidelines at right.

DISASSEMBLE, WASH AND DISINFECT Take apart any item that can be cleaned in pieces. If possible, remove handles from pots. If you have a dishwasher and the hot water temperature is at least 140 degrees F., use a long wash cycle and heated drying cycle to clean and disinfect dishwasher-safe items. Regarding other items, or all items if you don\\'t have a dishwasher, follow these steps: Wash all items in a a strong detergent solution. Use a brush to remove dirt. Rinse in hot water. Immerse glass, porcelain, china, plastic dinnerware and enamelware for 10 minutes in a disinfecting solution of 2 tablespoons of chlorine bleach per gallon of hot water. Disinfect silverware, metal utensils, and pots and pans by boiling in water for 10 minutes. Chlorine bleach should not be used in this case because it reacts with many metals and causes them to darken. Air-dry dishes. Do not use a towel. Discard and replace soft, porous plastic or wood items saturated by floodwater, since they cannot be sanitized. These include baby bottles, nipples and pacifiers. If cupboards and counters come in contact with floodwater, clean and rinse them with a chlorine bleach solution before storing dishes.

Thoroughly inspect shingles on the ridge, gable ends and eaves. Loose nails on metal roofing. Inspect the entire roof, with particular attention to gable ends, eaves and ridge cap. If nails have worked loose, re-nail them as soon as possible. If the nails don\\'t hold when hammered back in, use 12 or 14 metal screws to fill old nail holes. (Use aluminum screws on aluminum and steel screws on steel.) In addition to screws, re-nail 3 to 4 inches away with ring or screw-type nails. Potential leaks. On a sunny day, check the roof carefully from inside with the building doors closed. While looking for holes in the roof, inspect the ridge, gable ends and eaves for possible structural separation. FOUNDATION Inspect the foundation. The plate should not be separated from the studding where the foundation meets the walls. On block foundations, inspect mortar joints to make sure the block with the plate bolt in it hasn\\'t separated from the wall. On stone or concrete foundations, check to see that the plate bolts have not worked loose. SILO Make sure the silo is still plumb. Look for loose hoops. Inspect the roof to be sure it remains fastened to the silo. Inspect the base of metal silos inside and outside for hairline cracks. If there is rust around the base, remove it with a wire brush. Then check for cracks and apply a rust preventive paint. Look for new cracks in the plaster of empty concrete stave silos. INTERIOR Inspect the interior of buildings for structural damage. Using a good light, check the framing. Look for ridge separation, loose knee braces and loose rafters where the rafters join the walls. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension TORNADOES-CLEAN-UP/REPAIR Assessing Roof Damage After a Tornado REPAIR STRATEGIES FOR HOMEOWNERS If your roof has suffered structural damage from a tornado, make family safety your first priority. In some cases, such as a partially collapsed roof, you may need to relocate until repairs are made. Next, report damage to your insurance company. If you must make temporary repairs before an insurance adjuster\\'s visit, take photographs or make a videotape of damage. You will need good records for insurance claims, applications for disaster assistance and income tax deductions. WORKING WITH YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY Call your insurance agent about the damage to your home and roof so that your agent can file a claim. The sooner you talk to your agent, the sooner your claim will be filed and an adjuster will inspect your damage. The amount of coverage for your loss depends on your policy. But even if you don\\'t have full coverage, your agent may be able to give you advice on where to get help with repairs. Because some damage may not be discovered until repairs are underway, don\\'t be in a hurry to settle your insurance claim. Instead, keep your insurance agent apprised of repair estimates and repairs; have your building contractor or roofer discuss repairs and estimates with your agent if possible. Only settle your claim when you feel all repairs are known and/or made. That way, if related problems such as water damage, foundation damage or the need for new wiring are uncovered during reconstruction, your insurance settlement may reflect these as well. (See the fact sheet “Insurance Coverage and Making a Claim.”) TEMPORARY REPAIRS If temporary repairs are needed before the professionals arrive, be sure that only a physically able person is allowed on the roof. Unsteadiness on the ladder or roof can lead to severe injuries. If the roof is sagging from structural damage, wait for a professional to assess damage and make repairs; a sagging roof may unexpectedly collapse. Cover holes in the roof, walls or windows with boards, tarps or plastic sheeting. If possible, place tarps or plastic over the ridge so rain rolls off. Nail down plastic sheets or trash bags with strips of wood and secure them with duct tape. If the holes are large, you may need to support the plastic in the center to keep it from ripping from the weight of the rain. If sections of the roof or floors are sagging, have a contractor or other knowledgeable person brace weak areas. Improper bracing may increase damage and the chance of injury, so do not attempt this work unless you are experienced in structural repairs. PERMANENT REPAIRS If damage is limited to non-structural elements such as shingles, flashing and sheathing, contact a professional roofer for the work. If damage is structural in nature, hire a general contractor. (See the fact sheet, “Hiring University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension TORNADOES-CLEAN-UP/REPAIR more information Additional resources: Your family living agent, your local emergency government office, the American Red Cross, the Federal Emergency Management Agency a Contractor After a Disaster.”) A general contractor can replace the entire roof structure or portions of the roof as necessary, in addition to handling related repairs. If the contractor does not have roofing expertise (e.g. shingles, sheathing, etc.), he may subcontract this portion of the work to a specialist. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension w i n t e r s t o r m s Winter Storm Preparedness and Response SAFETY AT HOME AND WHILE TRAVELING Winter storms are worth serious consideration in Wisconsin. Blizzards, heavy snow, freezing rain and sub-zero temperatures hit hard and frequently across the state. Even if you think you are safe and warm at home, a winter storm can become dangerous if the power is cut off. With a little planning, you can protect yourself and your family from the many hazards of winter weather, both at home and on the road. BE AWARE OF THE FORECAST Winter weather advisory. Formerly called a “travelers\\' advisory,” this alert may be issued by the National Weather Service for a variety of severe conditions. Weather advisories may be announced for snow, blowing and drifting snow, freezing drizzle, freezing rain (when less than ice storm conditions are expected), or a combination of weather events. Winter storm watch. Severe winter weather conditions may affect your area (freezing rain, sleet or heavy snow may occur either separately or in combination). Winter storm warning. Severe winter weather conditions are imminent. Freezing rain or freezing drizzle. Rain or drizzle is likely to freeze upon impact, resulting in a coating of ice glaze on roads and all other exposed objects. Sleet. Small particles of ice, usually mixed with rain. If enough sleet accumulates on the ground, it makes travel hazardous. Blizzard warning. Sustained wind speeds of at least 35 miles per hour are accompanied by considerable falling and/or blowing snow. This is the most perilous winter storm, with visibility dangerously restricted. Wind chill. A strong wind combined with a temperature slightly below freezing can have the same chilling effect as a temperature nearly 50 degrees lower in a calm atmosphere. The combined cooling power of the wind and temperature on exposed flesh is called the wind-chill factor. BE PREPARED AT HOME Keep a battery-powered radio and flashlights in working order; stock extra batteries. Store food that can be prepared without an electric or gas stove. Stock emergency water and cooking supplies. Have candles and matches available in case of a power outage. Have sufficient heating fuel; regular fuel sources may be cut off. Have some kind of emergency heating equipment and fuel (a kerosene heater, a gas fireplace or wood-burning stove or fireplace) so you can keep at least one room of your house warm if power is cut off. (See the fact sheet “Staying Warm in an Unheated House.”) University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension more information IF STRANDED ON THE ROAD If your vehicle becomes stalled or stopped in a winter storm, follow these tips until help arrives. Keep calm and stay in your vehicle. Do not attempt to walk out of a blizzard. You are much more likely to be found by staying in your vehicle. Keep fresh air in your vehicle — especially if you are using a candle, solid fuel or other type of heating device — to prevent carbon monoxide build-up and oxygen starvation. Run motor and heater sparingly and only with the down-wind window open for ventilation. Make sure snow has not blocked the exhaust pipe. Turn on dome light at night. This helps make the vehicle visible for work crews. Keep watch. Do not permit all occupants to sleep at once. Exercise. Clapping hands and moving arms and legs vigorously will help keep you awake and improve circulation. Additional resources: The National Weather Service and local radio stations, your county family living agent, the Wisconsin Division of Emergency Government, the Federal Emergency Management Agency Related publications: “Winter Travel Awareness,” BE PREPARED IN YOUR CAR Keep your car “winterized” with antifreeze. Carry a winter car kit that includes a windshield scraper, flashlight, candle and matches, tow chain or rope, shovel, tire chains, blanket, extra mittens, bag of sand or salt, a fluorescent distress flag and an emergency flare. RIDING OUT A STORM AT HOME If you are isolated at home, listen to the radio or television for updates on weather conditions. Conserve fuel by keeping your house cooler than usual and by temporarily “closing off” heat to some rooms. When emergency heating methods must be used, maintain adequate ventilation to avoid build-up of toxic fumes. (See the fact sheet, “Staying Warm in an Unheated House.”) Dress accordingly. Layer your clothing; many layers of thin clothing are warmer than single layers of thick clothing. If you need to go outdoors or the heat is off indoors, wear mittens; they are warmer than gloves. Wear a hat; most body heat is lost through the top of the head. Cover your mouth with scarves to protect your lungs from directly inhaling extremely cold air. If shoveling snow isn\\'t critical, don\\'t do it. If you must shovel snow, take your time and lift small amounts. Over-exertion can bring on a heart attack — a major cause of death during and after winter storms. IF TRAVELING IN BAD WEATHER Use public transportation, if possible. Try not to travel alone during a storm. Make sure your vehicle is in good operating condition, winterized, properly serviced and equipped with snow or all weather tires. Be sure your headlights, taillights and windows are clean so you can see and be seen. Listen to your radio for weather information. Always fill your gas tank before entering open country, even for short distances. You are less likely to get stranded with a full tank. If you do get stranded, you will have enough gas to run the motor and heat the vehicle. Let someone know your departure time, expected arrival time and route. Seek shelter immediately if the storm seems severe. Don\\'t be foolhardy. Drive carefully and defensively. Don\\'t try to save time by traveling faster than road and weather conditions permit. Never carry spare fuel inside the vehicle or the trunk. Gasoline fumes can build up and cause a violent explosion. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Wisconsin Division of Emergency Government University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Protecting Plumbing During a Winter Storm CARE OF UTILITIES AND APPLIANCES WHEN THE POWER IS OUT If the heat will be off in your home for several days during a winter storm, you should protect exposed plumbing, sewage systems and appliances from freezing and subsequent damage. Frozen pipes could become a problem once the temperature inside the home falls below 40 degrees F. If some pipes have frozen, despite the fact that power has returned or exists, there are some simple measures to take. But whenever possible, get an expert for plumbing work or repairs. REDUCE THE CHANCE OF FROZEN PIPES Follow these steps to reduce the chance of pipes freezing during a power failure: Shut off the water at the main valve, or turn off the well pump if it is in the house. Turn the water heater off. An explosion could result if the heater is left on without water in the system. You will find either an electrical switch or gas valve for shutting off the appliance. Open all the faucets on the lower level, then the upper level. You may want to collect the water for household use. Insulate undrainable pipes around their main valves. Use newspaper, blankets or housing insulation. Unlike summer homes and cottages, modern housing is not usually designed for easy winterization. For this reason, you should contact a plumber or other expert if the house will be without heat for an extended period of time. Critical measures include: draining of toilets, water softening units, drain traps, sump pumps, heaters, humidifiers, dishwashers and other appliances that use water. WHEN PIPES FREEZE Under normal circumstances, most of us never have to worry about a frozen water pipe. Our plumbing pipes are on interior walls and are insulated well enough that water does not freeze. But frozen pipes may become a concern if the heat is off or if water pipes run through unheated crawl spaces, floors over garages or in outside walls. If pipes do freeze: Shut off the water supply and open faucets to the frozen pipes; Warm them with a heat lamp, blow dryer or portable heater; Do not use boiling water, propane torches or any open flame to thaw frozen pipes; Apply only moderate heat and expect to wait for several hours; Open sink cabinets to let in warm air. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension WINTER STORMS-HOME PROTECTION more information Additional resources: Your county family living agent If pipes have burst before you could take preventive action, immediately turn off their water supply. Try to locate the areas that need repair and call a plumber. LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS The long-term solution for frozen pipes is to provide adequate insulation and heat. Methods may include wrapping pipes with insulation material and installing weather stripping, insulation and heat to the room. A temporary or last resort solution is the use of electric heating tape, which can be wrapped around the pipes and energized when sub-zero weather is predicted. You can also leave faucets connected to exposed pipes trickling when low temperatures are forecasted. If the pipes are under an enclosed sink, open the door and use a fan to blow warm air from the room toward the pipes. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service, North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Ice Dam Prevention on Roofs SIMPLE WAYS TO ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEM Ice dams occur when a snow-covered roof over the attic is warmer than the eaves — the overhang of a roof. If the roof is warm, it will cause the snow to melt and run under snow along the roof. When the melted snow hits the cooler eaves, it freezes. As ice builds up on eaves, it eventually traps water behind it. The water backs up under shingles and finds its way through seams in the building paper and roof decking to enter the attic and living area. Wallpaper, plaster and paint surfaces may be damaged in the process. Fortunately, there are several ways to remedy the problem. Additional resources: Your county Extension office WHEN SEEPAGE HAS ALREADY BEGUN If you have an immediate problem with ice dams, you should remove the snow from the part of the roof directly above the ice dam. This limits the amount of water that can collect behind the dam. Remove the snow using a roof rake, hoe or push broom. Roof rakes have long handles that allow you to stay on the ground when clearing a single-story roof. You can purchase them at hardware stores. Avoid using sharp instruments, such as axes, to break channels through the ice. This is likely to cause roof and structure damage. PREVENTION A cooler attic area will help decrease problems with ice dams. Here are two ways to keep attics cool: Increase insulation in the attic to at least 12 inches. Also, close any thermal shortcuts —openings that allow air to move from the heated part of the house into the attic. Chases around chimneys, plumbing vents, junction boxes for ceiling light fixtures, attic hatches and ceiling fan mounts are common thermal shortcuts. Create adequate attic ventilation to remove any heat that escapes into the attic. One square foot of free ventilation opening is recommended for every 150 square feet of attic space. Ventilation should be divided between eaves and the house ridge to take advantage of the fact that warm air rises. When installing eave or soffit vents, be sure that the opening is not blocked by insulation. You can do that by installing a cardboard or plastic channel over the insulation lined up with each vent.

Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension WINTER STORMS-HOME PROTECTION Staying Warm in an Unheated House COPING WITH A POWER OUTAGE IN WINTER During severe winter storms, your home heating system could be inoperative for as long as several days. To minimize discomfort and possible health problems during this time, conserve body heat by dressing warmly; find or improvise an alternative heat source, such as a fireplace or electric space heater; confine heating to a single room; and keep safety a foremost consideration. While chances of freezing to death in your home are small, there\\'s a greater danger of death by fire, lack of oxygen or carbon monoxide poisoning. THINK “SAFETY FIRST” Safety is of extreme importance in a heating emergency. Follow these precautions: Do not burn anything larger than candles inside your home without providing adequate ventilation to the outside. Any type of heater (except electric) should be vented. Connect the stove pipe to a chimney flue if at all possible. (Many older homes have capped pipe thimbles in rooms once heated by stoves.) Or hook up your stove to the flue entrance of the non-functioning furnace pipe. If no other alternative exists, consider extending a stove pipe through a window. Replace the window glass with a metal sheet and run the temporary stove pipe through the metal. If you use a catalytic or unvented heater, cross-ventilate by opening a window an inch on each side of the room. It is better to let in some cold air than to run the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning. Do not use a gas or electric oven or surface units for heating. A gas oven may go out or burn inefficiently, leading to carbon monoxide poisoning. An electric oven was not designed for space heating. Do not burn outdoor barbecue materials such as charcoal briquettes inside — even in a fireplace. Do not try to use bottled gas in natural gas appliances unless you have converted the appliances for such use. Also, flues and piping suitable for gas burning appliances may be unsafe for use with higher-temperature oil, coal or wood smoke. Have one person watch for fire whenever alternative heat sources are used. One person should also stay awake to watch for fire and to make sure ventilation is adequate. If the designated person feels drowsy or has a headache, it may be a sign of inadequate ventilation. Keep firefighting materials on hand. These may include: dry powder fire extinguishers, a tarp or heavy blanket, sand, salt, baking soda and water. CONSERVE BODY HEAT Put on extra clothing. If cold is severe, your bed may be the warmest place. Use extra blankets and coverings to trap body heat; this is an especially good way to keep children warm. Farm families might consider taking refuge in the relative warmth of the livestock barn. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension WINTER STORMS-HOME/FARM SAFETY more information Additional resources: Your county family living agent, your local power company FIND OR IMPROVISE AN ALTERNATIVE HEAT SOURCE You may have alternative heating resources around your home. Possibilities include: fireplace, space heater, catalytic camp stove wood, gas or oil heater gas-fired hot water heater PROVIDE FUEL Some common materials that could be used for fuel include: firewood, newspapers, magazines camp stove fuel, kerosene wood chips, straw, corncobs You can burn coal in a fireplace or stove if you make a grate to hold it, allowing air to circulate underneath. “Hardware cloth” screening placed on a standard wood grate will keep coal from falling through. Tightly rolled newspapers or magazines can be used as paper “logs.” Stack them as you would stack firewood to allow for air circulation. If the heating situation becomes critical, consider burning wood, including lumber or furniture. SELECT A ROOM TO BE HEATED To increase efficiency of available heat, close off all rooms except the one to be heated. When selecting a room, consider the following: If using a vented stove or space heater, select a room with a stove or chimney flue. Confine emergency heat to a small area. Try to select a room on the “warm” side of the house, away from prevailing winds. Avoid rooms with large windows or uninsulated walls. Interior bathrooms probably have the lowest air leakage and heat loss. Your basement may be a warm place in cold weather because the earth acts as insulation and minimizes heat loss. Isolate the room from the rest of the house by keeping doors closed, hanging bedding or heavy drapes over entryways, or by erecting temporary partitions of cardboard or plywood. Hang drapes, bedding or shower curtains over doors and windows, Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Winter Power Failure on the Farm KEEPING ANIMALS AND EQUIPMENT SAFE A winter power failure or fuel shortage can cause problems on farms, but being prepared can keep problems to a minimum. Ideally you should have a standby electric generator for emergency power. For ideas on types of generators and their operation, see the fact sheet “Using Standby Electric Generators.” Assuming you have no power, take the following precautions to keep animals and equipment safe. POULTRY AND LIVESTOCK To protect poultry and livestock during a power failure: Ventilate buildings. Do not close buildings tight to conserve heat, since animals could suffocate from lack of oxygen. Clear ice and snow from all vents because oxygen will eventually be used up in mechanically ventilated production facilities. Then open vents to facilitate natural air flow. Provide water. All animals, especially cattle, need plenty of water during cold weather. It may be possible to drive your water pump with a small gasoline engine and a belt. Otherwise, you will need to haul water. If you have an outside source of water, cattle can be turned out to drink it. Be sure to place sand or other gritty material on icy feedlots to provide good footing. Whatever the source of water, watch that it remains unfrozen so animals can drink it. Provide heat. Use camp stoves and heaters as emergency heat sources for brooders. Plan ahead to have this equipment ready when needed. Provide feed. Animals need extra energy for body heat during severe or prolonged cold weather, especially if they are outside without shelter. Mechanical feeders will be inoperable during a power failure. Provide for emergency feeding procedures. EQUIPMENT Unplug or turn off all electric equipment to prevent damage when power is restored. If you use portable space heaters for supplemental heat, close off the fuel valve as soon as possible after power is interrupted. (On models not equipped with safety shut-offs, and especially on some models with gravity feed fuel systems, fuel continues to flow even when the burner is inoperative. An explosion or fire could result when power is restored.) STORING MILK Request that the dairy pick up milk as soon as possible. Consider adding a standby power generator to handle vital electric equipment. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension WINTER STORMS-HOME/FARM SAFETY more information Additional resources: Your county agricultural agent Even if you are short of extra milk storage facilities, do not store milk in stock tanks or other containers. Dairy plants may not accept milk that has been stored in anything other than regular milk storage containers. Check with your local dairy about policy regarding emergency storage of milk. If you are unable to cool your milk or have it picked up, check your tank for souring each time you add milk to it. This check could mean the difference between losing all or only part of your milk supply. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Animal Safety in Winter PROVIDING ADEQUATE SHELTER, FEED AND WATER For animals normally kept outside during the winter, safety can be a concern during extended periods of severe cold, snow or wet conditions. Wind coupled with severe or prolonged cold weather causes additional stress on livestock, increasing their needs for shelter, food and water. PROVIDE SHELTER Severe cold alone usually will not affect the performance of large animals on full feed. Wind, however, can be a serious stress factor. A strong wind has about the same effect on animals as exposure to a sudden drop in temperature. In general, a 20 mph wind is about equivalent to a 30 degree F. drop in temperature. Under extreme conditions, simple wind and snow protection devices will not be 100 percent effective. Move stock, especially the young, into sheltered areas during severe periods of cold. Adequate shelter is important because animals\\' extremities are subject to freezing during sub-zero weather. Extremities that become wet or are normally wet are particularly subject to frostbite and freezing. The loss of ears or tails could be of little economic significance, but damage to male reproductive organs could impair the animals\\' fertility or ability to breed. Frozen and chapped teats will impact milk production. Shallow open-front sheds provide excellent shelters for livestock. Such shelters should have slots along the eaves on the back side. The openings provide ventilation and prevent snow from swirling into the front of the shed. Use a 1-inch slot per 10 feet of building width. Continuous ridge openings of 2 inches also are recommended for each 10 feet of building width. Solid-sided feed wagons work well for temporary wind protection. Attach plywood or locate bales of straw or feed at the bottom of the wagon to block wind from moving under the wagon. Windbreaks, properly oriented and laid out, or timber-covered lowlands make good protection for range cattle. Unlike shed-type shelters, windbreaks eliminate concerns about overcrowding or proper ventilation. Never close shelters tightly, since stock could suffocate from lack of oxygen. Additional bedding is helpful to keep animals insulated from the ground and to keep them dry during cold periods. PROVIDE EXTRA FEED During severe or prolonged cold weather, animals need extra feed to provide body heat and to maintain production weight gains. Provide them University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension WINTER STORMS-HOME/FARM SAFETY more information Additional resources: Your county agricultural agent, the National Weather Service for livestock safety warnings with additional, higher fiber feeds such as hay or hay mixed with oat straw. A good formula during cold weather is to increase feed 1 percent for every degree drop in temperature below 32 degrees F. For example, when the temperature drops from 32 degrees F. to 0 degrees, provide 32 percent more feed (break this into three or four feedings a day). Usually, animals instinctively eat more feed if a storm is approaching. Remember that mechanized feeders may be inoperable during power failures. Unless you have a source of emergency power, you may need extra labor to feed, water and care for animals by hand. PROVIDE WATER Dehydration is often a greater hazard during winter storms than cold or suffocation. Cattle cannot lick enough snow to satisfy their water requirements. They also will need more water if they are eating a higher-fiber diet. Use heaters in water tanks to provide livestock with enough water. Or, only pump out as much water as needed twice a day, to avoid problems with freezing water. If pipes freeze or power is out, you may need to haul water to animals. WATCH YOUR LIVESTOCK Watch your livestock carefully during winter storms and periods of severe cold. Keep them moving. If you see them shivering, not moving or acting abnormally, call your veterinarian. In particular, watch younger cattle for signs of trouble. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Standby Electric Generators A SOURCE OF EMERGENCY POWER FOR FARMERS An emergency source of power is important for any farm with mechanically ventilated production facilities, bulk milk handling equipment, mechanical feeding equipment or facilities requiring constant and continuous heat (such as brooders). On such a farm, a standby electric generator is a good investment, possibly preventing costly losses during a power failure. During disasters such as flood or tornado, relief agencies may provide generators to farmers on an emergency basis. TYPES OF GENERATORS Standby generators are either engine driven or tractor driven. Either type can be stationary or portable. Engine driven units can be either manual or automatic start. Gasoline-, LP gas- (bottled gas) and diesel-fueled engines are available. Generators must provide the same type of power at the same voltage and frequency as that supplied by power lines. This is usually 120/240 volt, single phase, 60 cycle alternating current (AC). An air-cooled engine is often used for generators up to 15 kilowatts. A liquid-cooled engine is necessary for generators larger than 15 kilowatts. Engine capacity of 2 to 2 1/4 hp with the proper drive system must be available for each 1,000 watts of generator output. SIZE OF GENERATORS A full-load system will handle the entire farmstead load. Automatic engine-powered, full-load systems will begin to furnish power immediately, or up to 30 seconds after power is off. Smaller and less expensive part-load systems may be enough to handle essential equipment during an emergency. Power-take-off (PTO) generators are about half as costly as engine-operated units. Under a part-load system, only the most essential equipment is operated at one time. For most farms, this type of system is adequate, provided the generator is sized to start the largest motor. For example, the milk cooler or ventilation fan would need to be operated continuously, but the operation of the silo unloader and mechanical feeding system could be postponed until the milking chores are completed. PTO units can be mounted on a trailer. INSTALLATION Wiring and equipment must be installed in accordance with the National Electrical Code, local ordinances and the requirements of your power supplier. It is essential that you have the proper equipment for disconnecting the generator from public utility lines. Most companies require the installation of a double-pole double-throw transfer switch or its equivalent for this purpose. Check with your electrician or power supply representative for installation, installation instructions and inspection.

LOCATION AND SAFETY FEATURES Large engine generators should be located in a building, preferably a heated building. Inlet and outlet air ducts must be large enough to carry off excess heat. They should be open at least a half a square foot for each 1,000 watts of generator capacity. Combustion fumes must be carried outdoors safely. Exhaust pipes must be at least 6 inches from combustible material. OPERATION An automatic standby unit should start automatically when power fails, and stop when power is restored. When using an engine-driven generator with a manual start, or when using a tractor driven unit, follow this procedure when power fails: Call your power supplier and advise them of the conditions. Turn off or disconnect all electrical equipment. Position the tractor or engine for belt of PTO drive. Start the unit and bring the generator up to proper speed (1,800 or 3,600 rps). Check on arrangement to carry off exhaust fumes. Be sure there is no danger of fire. The voltmeter will indicate when the generator is ready to carry the load. Put the transfer switch in the generator position. Start the largest electrical motor first, adding other loads when each is up to operating speed. Do not add too much too fast. If the generator cuts out for any reason, repeat the second, third and fourth steps above. Check the voltmeter frequently. If voltage falls below 200 volts for 240 volt service or below 100 volts for 120 volt service, reduce the load on the generator by turning off some electrical equipment. When commercial power is restored, put the transfer switch in normal power position. Then stop the standby unit. MAINTENANCE Keep the unit clean and in good running order at all times so it will be ready for immediate use. Dust and dirt accumulations on the motor can cause it to overheat when operated. Follow maintenance instructions in manufacturer\\'s manual. A short operation at set intervals will keep the engine in good operating condition. Regularly scheduled warm-ups are necessary to keep a standby engine in working order. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Winter Kill of Alfalfa PROMOTING WINTER HARDINESS AND MANAGING DAMAGE Winter kill of alfalfa cannot be avoided entirely in a bad year, but you can minimize its destruction with good manage-ment practices. Frequency of cutting, date of last cutting, and fertilizing are all factors you can control before the first freeze. Once damage is done, careful assessment of your stands can increase your success with reseeding. Contributors to winter kill include low temperatures, ice cover and repeated freezing and thawing. When repeated freezing and thawing cause ice heave, the crown of the plant is forced out of the soil and alfalfa roots may break. Disease also is a contributor to winter kill. The weather conditions described above can lead to disease; but conversely, stands that already are diseased are more susceptible to winter kill. Typical diseases include bacterial wilt, fusarium wilt, phytophthora and root rot. PREVENTION OF WINTER KILL Factors affecting winter kill include: Age of the stand. The younger the stand, the greater its winter hardiness. Alfalfa variety. Varieties can make a difference; choose proven winter hardy varieties. For up-to-date information, see the annual Cooperative Extension publication, “Forage Variety Update for Wisconsin.” Soil fertility. High soil fertility can minimize the chances of winter kill. Use a soil test to be sure potassium levels are in the optimum range. A fall application of fertilizer can be helpful. Adjust fertilizers for the amount of annual growth. Cutting frequency for the previous season. The more frequently stands are cut, the more susceptible they are to winter kill. Try to let the alfalfa mature to 10 percent bloom at one harvest to rebuild the stand condition. Date of last fall cutting. A late fall cutting is not recommended, particularly if you cut frequently during the season. If possible, take your last cutting before Sept. 1. If you must cut late in the season, try to cut high (leaving 6 to 8 inches of stubble). This leaves a layer of insulation for the crown. The higher stems also can reduce suffocation when ice cover is a problem. The amount of growth prior to killing frost. The greater the growth, the better the chance of survival. ASSESSING STANDS IN SPRING After frost is out, inspect alfalfa plants for root and crown condition. If plant roots are not fleshy or off-white, plants are dead or dying. If plants have considerable crown or root rot, they are likely to die. However, keep in mind that after the first year of growth, all plants will show some signs of crown rot; therefore, look for degree of severity.

Compare stands to the following chart: STAND DENSITY REQUIRED FOR MAXIMUM YIELD First year after seeding 20-25 per square foot Second year after seeding 12-15 per square foot Third year after seeding 6-8 per square foot If plant counts are significantly less than those in the chart, expect reduced yields and increased weed problems. You may need to plow damaged areas down and reseed. But keep in mind your first assessment is preliminary; it is only intended to eliminate the worst stands. The final assessment cannot be made until after plants begin to green up. Some stands are weakened and show injury in spring. Others look healthy at first, but die later in the spring. CONSIDERATIONS FOR RESEEDING Your reseeding options vary depending upon age of stands and when winter kill occurred. If winter kill occurred in early winter, you have more options for reseeding because there will be less autotoxicity in plants. Autotoxicity is caused by an accumulation of one or more compounds that inhibit germination and growth of new alfalfa seedlings. It is found in old stands of alfalfa. Since it takes time for the autotoxic factor to degrade, stands killed in early winter may have less autotoxicity than those killed in spring. If stands were seeded last year, disk to destroy remaining plants in affected areas of the field and reseed alfalfa at a rate of 12 pounds per acre. Use a variety with a high level of resistance (HR) to phytophthora root rot and one that has been treated with the fungicide Apron. It may be possible to reseed only affected areas of the field. If stands were seeded two years ago, autotoxicity may be a problem. If kill occurred in early winter, reseed as directed above. If kill occurred toward spring or date of kill is unknown, disk areas to be reseeded and wait two to three weeks before reseeding. Use an Apron-treated alfalfa variety with a high level of resistance (HR) to phytophthora root rot. If stands were seeded three years ago or more, reseeding success is likely to be reduced by autotoxicity. If stand kill occurred early in winter, till areas to be reseeded and wait two to three weeks before seeding. Use an Apron-treated alfalfa variety with a high level of resistance (HR) to phytophthora root rot. The best option is to interseed with red clover at 8 pounds per acre or with an annual or perennial ryegrass at a seeding rate of 8 to 15 pounds per acre, depending on density of remaining alfalfa stand. If winter kill occurred in spring, consider seeding another crop, such as a grain or annual forage like sorghum-sudan grass. Then reseed alfalfa in August or next year. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Winter Kill of Small Grains PROMOTING WINTER HARDINESS AND MANAGING DAMAGE Unstable winter temperatures and lack of snow cover take most of the blame for winter kill of small grains. But other variables play a part as well. Two major factors are planting dates and the grain varieties used. Generally, early planting yields more winter hardiness, better stands and higher yields. Grain varieties with excellent winter hardiness can make a big difference for growers as well. Despite your best efforts, however, winter kill may cause serious damage. If stands are thin, you have several options, ranging from fertilizing to replanting to applying for disaster payments. PLANTING GUIDELINES FOR THE FALL Test soil to determine fertility of field. Control perennial weeds, such as quackgrass. Use good tillage practices. Fertilize to a yield goal of 100 to 150 bushels per acre. a) Use nitrogen at 25 lb. per acre. b) Use phosphorous and potassium at high levels prior to planting. Select a variety with the highest yield for your area, as well as good winter hardiness. Consult with your county Extension office for current data as necessary. Public winter wheat varieties Glacier and Merrimac, for example, are rated “excellent” for winter hardiness in Wisconsin; Cardinal, Caldwell and Howell are rated “good.” Plant at the optimum date for your area, considering location and likelihood of aphid infestation. For high winter hardy varieties like Glacier and Merrimac, for example, planting dates are: a) Sept. 15-Oct. 10 in southern Wisconsin. b) Sept. 10-Oct. 5 in central Wisconsin. c) Sept.1-20 in northern Wisconsin. Planting dates for varieties with medium winter hardiness, such as Cardinal, Caldwell and Howell, are: a) Sept. 1-15 in southern Wisconsin. b) Aug. 25-Sept. 15 in central Wisconsin. c) Aug. 20-Sept. 10 in northern Wisconsin. Plant in 4- to 7-inch row spacings, incorporating tramlines for subsequent management practices. Plant 30 to 40 seeds per square foot. ASSESSING THE STAND IN SPRING Check stand density in the spring as soon as winter survival can be rated. a) If stand is adequate (more than 18 plants per foot of row), apply 25 lb. of nitrogen per acre just prior to or at tillering time (Growth Stage 20). University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension WINTER STORMS-SALVAGING PLANTS/TREES more information Additional resources: Your county agricultural agent Related publications: UW-Extension publication “Small Grain Varieties for Grain and Forage in Wisconsin,” (A3397). b) If stand is poor (fewer than 18 plants per foot of row), apply up to 50 lb. of nitrogen to promote tillering. Use proper weed control measures if weeds are anticipated to be a problem. Apply an additional 50 to 75 pounds of nitrogen at stem elongation (Growth Stage 30) for grain filling. Apply fungicides as needed for disease control during the growing season. Harvest on time at optimum grain moisture. Provide for adequate, safe storage space. COMMON QUESTIONS When isn\\'t a crop worth saving? If you see fewer than six plants per square foot, consider ripping them up and replanting something else, such as spring wheat, barley or oats. Should you interseed spring wheat if the stand is poor? Generally, the disadvantages of interseeding outweigh the advantages. For one thing, differences in maturation rates mean harvest loss and and a lesser quality of wheat. Secondly, hard-red spring wheats and soft-red winter wheats are used in different ways, making them difficult to sell as a mixed-class wheat. If you plan to use the crop for feed, however, this is not a serious concern. Should you claim a loss through the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS)? If you are enrolled in the wheat program and you had major damage from winter kill, this may be the best solution. Consult with your county agricultural agent and ASCS personnel if you need help making this decision. If the claim is approved you may be able to collect a disaster payment, replant spring small grains or corn and still protect your wheat base. What weather conditions will increase the chances of winter kill? a) A rapid drop in temperature in the fall instead of a gradual drop. This will increase chances of winter kill because plants don\\'t have time to develop winter hardiness. b) Lack of snow cover and repeated warming and freezing. These conditions occur frequently in the months of February and March. In some cases, plants will break dormancy and start growing before winter conditions have ended. In other cases, plants may be smothered by ice sheets, ponding and flooding that develop. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension f i r e Fire Prevention and Safety on the Farm SOUND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES FOR PRODUCERS Fire prevention is critical on any farm, but sometimes overlooked until it is too late. The heat and smoke of fire, along with the toxic gases and rapid loss of oxygen, can kill quickly. Without prevention and safe management practices, you put your own life at risk, as well as that of family members, employees and animals. On top of that, your farm buildings, equipment and means of earning an income can be wiped out in minutes. Safe management practices can make the difference. For starters, you should: Avoid “building in” fire hazards in the initial construc-tion of your farm buildings and management practices. For example, use all noncombustible or flame-retardent materials possible. Also, keep motors and machine tools free of dust and grease. Fight fire before it starts by keeping all ignition sources away from combustible material in and around your farm buildings. Get proper fire insurance coverage for your livestock, buildings and equipment. MAKE TIME FOR INSPECTIONS AND FIRE DRILLS Invite your local fire department to your farm. Let them get acquainted with your facilities and help identify any fire hazards. Ask for their input in making your operation more fire-safe and fire-proof. Develop and carry out a fire safety inspection for animal buildings and other buildings. Follow a routine preventive maintenance schedule and checklist for fire hazards. Conduct regular fire drills, so all family members and employees know what they should do. After a drill, hold a meeting to discuss improvements in procedures and equipment. Educate yourself and others about fire safety practices. Update and upgrade your farm buildings in accordance with the latest National Electrical Code. Use all noncombustible materials. Install a lightning protection system and inspect it periodically. KEEP THINGS CLEAN AND IN GOOD REPAIR Make good housekeeping part of your daily routine. Cut down and remove weeds and brush from around buildings. Keep work areas clean, dry and unobstructed. Never block exits or aisles, even for a few minutes. If you have a poultry building, check for excessive accumulations of dust, down feathers or cobwebs on sides, roof or rafters. Find a place for everything and keep it there. Test your fire or smoke alarm system at least once a year. Likewise, flush outside private fire hydrants at least once a year. Check fire doors and shutters on a regular basis to make sure they are free of any obstructions and in good operating condition. Check all water control valves and air and water pressures of automatic sprinkler systems every week. Make sure that power needs for ventilation, feed distribution and other functions are met without overloading your electrical system. Follow the National Electrical Code. Use good material and proper fuse size or circuit breaker rating. Use junction boxes at all splice points. Use waterproof wiring and receptacles, enclosed electric motors and similar equipment in any buildings which are cleaned periodically with high-pressure equipment. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension - more information FIRE EXTINGUISHER TIP Remember the phrase P-A-S-S if you attempt to put out a small fire with an extinguisher. P is for pull the pin of the extinguisher (or with some units, Press the puncture lever or release the lock hatch); A is for aim low or point the unit\\'s nozzle at the base of the fire; S is for squeeze the handle to release the extinguishing agent; and the other S is for sweep from side to side. Keep the extinguisher aimed at the base of the fire and sweep back and forth until it appears to be out. Never turn your back on a small fire, even if it looks as if it is out. Be prepared in case it flashes again.

The National Fire Protection Association Catalog, available by calling (800) 344-3555. Inspect all wiring and electric motors and appliances for exposed wires, broken insulation, improper grounding and improper installation. Equip motors with thermal overload relays or cutouts. Check the heating system to make certain that every furnace or stove is in good repair. See that ducts and air shafts are clean of dust and debris, motors are cleaned and oiled (if necessary) each season, and pulley belts are in good working order. Check gas and fuel oil systems for leaks and unsafe installations. Keep all types of heating devices and other equipment clean and in good condition. MINIMIZE HAZARDS ON SITE Strictly enforce a “no smoking” rule inside any buildings or areas where flammable and combustible materials are stored. Never smoke near storage, shipping or receiving areas where boxes or other containers can easily start a fire. Be extremely careful when handling gasoline. It is flammable and explosive. If your clothing becomes contaminated with a flammable material, change immediately. Never refuel gasoline engines while they are running or hot. Keep flammable liquids in labeled safety containers and store them in approved flammable-liquid safety cabinets. Keep above-ground fuel storage tanks at least 40 feet from buildings. This setback minimizes the potential for fire spread and generally is required for compliance with Wisconsin\\'s Flammable and Combustible Liquids Code, ILHR 10. For more information, contact your regional storage tank inspector at the Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations. KNOW YOUR FIRE EXTINGUISHERS Select and provide proper fire extinguishers. Always make sure the unit on the wall matches the type of fires that could develop in that area. There are different types of extinguishers for different kinds of fires. If you use the wrong unit on a fast-moving fire, you can cause the fire to spread even faster. Read the extinguisher\\'s instructions to learn how to use the extinguisher before a fire ever starts. Make sure all extinguishers are serviced, maintained and tagged at intervals, not to exceed one year. Know your limits and always think safety first. Fire extinguishers cannot do the job of a local fire department. When a fire burns for more than a couple of minutes, the heat starts to build up and intensify. Once that happens, you are past a point of first aid. Get out of the building and let firefighters handle the situation. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, University of California at Modesto Cooperative Extension Service, the National Fire Protection Association University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Farmstead Evacuation During a Fire SETTING PRIORITIES IN AN EMERGENCY Fires are dangerous anywhere, but on the farm they pose unique perils for animals and their owners. Toxic fumes can kill or cause permanent lung damage. Panicked animals behave unpredictably or refuse to respond to normal handling approaches. They may trap themselves and their rescuers in a rapidly spreading fire. Work with your local fire department to minimize fire risk on your farm. Formulate an emergency fire plan and practice it regularly with family members and employees. Likewise, conduct periodic fire safety inspections. (See the fact sheet “Fire Prevention and Safety on the Farm.”) Above all, remember that your first priority should always be human safety—and that includes you. PRIORITIES People have been seriously injured or killed when trying to save animals, grain or equipment on their farms. They forget that smoke and toxic fumes can kill them in seconds. Human safety, including your own life, must be your first priority. Make sure you, your family members and employees are safe. Call the fire department immediately and let the experts take control. If you can use a fire extinguisher on a small fire, do so. But realize its limitations in the face of a fast-moving blaze. Your property, as a business investment, comes second. When your farmstead is burning, it\\'s time to make your hardest business decisions. Firefighting crews may ask you which building to save first, second, third, etc. Ask yourself if it is more important to save livestock, machinery or feed. If a livestock building is on fire, animals may already have been exposed to deadly heat, smoke and gases. It may be safer and more realistic to save an adjacent building or vehicles stored inside it. CALLING THE FIRE DEPARTMENT When calling the fire department, be prepared to give accurate and complete information, including: a) The exact location of your farm. b) The extent and location of the fire. c) The color of smoke coming from the burning structure(s). For example: “A lot of black smoke is coming from the back of the vehicle storage building.” This helps firefighters know what materials are burning and what materials they need to fight the fire. d) Anything else the dispatcher requests. Stay on the line until the dispatcher is through collecting all the necessary information. Make sure the fire department has complete access to the blaze. Do not let vehicles, livestock or people block the driveway or access to buildings. This is a typical problem for firefighters. It can only lead to greater damage and danger for all concerned. Alert firefighters to potential hazards, including pesticide and chemical storage areas and fuel tanks. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension FIRE-FARM EVACUATION more information AFFECTED LIVESTOCK If animals have suffered from heat, smoke inhalation or burns, get a veterinarian to examine and treat them immediately. If possible, spray water on animals to cool them. Some animals may need to be destroyed. According to meat safety laws in Wisconsin, animals that have died from fire (or any means other than slaughter) are automatically condemned and cannot be sold for food. Injured animals need state certification from a veterinarian before they can be sold for slaughter. For more information, call the Meat Inspection and Safety Bureau at the Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection at (608) 266-2227. Additional resources: Your local fire department, your county agricultural agent, the National Fire Protection Association Related publications: “Fire Control in Livestock Buildings,” (NRAES 39), the Northeast Regional LIVESTOCK BUILDINGS Livestock evacuation is very risky business. If fire or smoke is significant within an animal building, the danger is generally too great to risk your own life. Some considerations include: Smoke, fire, burning insulation and toxic fumes. Some types of insulation consume oxygen, give off poisonous smoke or “rain fire” — that is, they may melt and drip as they burn. Fiberglass doesn\\'t burn. Be aware of the type of insulation in your barns and anticipate how it might react in a blaze. Remember that smoke inhalation and heat already may have harmed your animals to the extent they need to be destroyed. Don\\'t be the next victim. Animals may refuse to leave the building. Cows and horses tend to panic if they are frightened or forced to use a secondary exit. In some cases, evacuated animals run back into burning buildings. Some farmers have had luck leading a few panicked animals out by throwing a gunnysack over their heads. Don\\'t become trapped. If you are able to evacuate animals, be sure you are not leading them toward a dead-end, such as a gate that won\\'t open outward. Containment may be the best answer. Oxygen fuels a fire. Sometimes it is best to close the doors and wait for the fire department. Poultry buildings, especially, are prone to flash fires because of their construction and the large amounts of dust inside. If you open the door, a burning poultry building is likely to burst into flames. Smoldering hay. If hay is slowly smoldering in an upper level of a barn or silo, call the fire department and, if possible, begin evacuation. This is one instance where you may have enough time for a quiet, orderly evacuation. DO NOT try to throw smoldering hay out a window or door; exposure to oxygen fuels a blaze. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension; the City of Fitchburg Fire Department, Dane County, Wisconsin University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Clean-up After a Fire on the Farm SAFETY CONCERNS AND WHERE TO GO FOR HELP Hazards may still exist after firefighters leave the scene of a farm fire. Contaminated water runoff and hazardous debris are two of the most common challenges for farmers during clean-up efforts. With a little foresight, you can avoid injury to yourself, your family and your livestock. You also can streamline clean-up and rebuilding. GENERAL GUIDELINES Contaminated water runoff. When water used in firefighting mixes with pesticides, fuels or other hazardous materials, the result is a harmful runoff. It poses an immediate threat to groundwater (including your wells), surface water, humans, animals and the environment. By law, appropriate steps must be taken for containment and clean-up. a) Notify authorities. If hazardous materials have been released in the course of firefighting, local and state authorities must be notified and consulted for legal clean-up methods. Immediately contact your Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC), as well as the Wisconsin Division of Emergency Government Spill Hotline at (800) 943-0003. b) Containment. In some cases, the fire department may help build dikes or ditches to help contain water runoff until local emergency response teams (hazardous materials specialists) arrive. In other cases, emergency response teams will be called in to contain and clean up the spill. If a spill is very small, officials may request that you clean up the spill and dispose of waste at the next Agricultural Clean Sweep event. In either case, try to direct hazardous runoff away from porous (sand or gravel) soils to avoid groundwater contamination. c) Take safety precautions. Wear protective gear if you must enter a contaminated area, such as a flooded pesticide storage room. Keep livestock away from contaminated waters. Place warning signs on contaminated areas and/or fence them off so that livestock, children or others aren\\'t accidentally exposed. Building debris. Before beginning clean-up, take photographs or make a videotape of damage. This will be helpful for insurance records and/or income tax loss deductions. Also, have an insurance adjuster inspect the premises. Based on insurance reimbursement and advice from a building inspector or contractor, make decisions about whether to rebuild or restore existing facilities (See the fact sheet, “Salvaging Buildings After a Fire.”) Some clean-up suggestions: a) Turn off the power to damaged buildings. Normally, power is shut off during firefighting. Nevertheless, be absolutely sure you are not dealing with live wires. b) Wear protective gear and use caution. Falling debris, exposed nails, glass, contaminants and sharp edges all pose hazards during clean-up. Wear steel-toed boots, a hard hat, gloves and other protective gear when necessary. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension FIRE-HOME/FARM RECOVERY more information Additional resources: Your county agricultural agent, your insurance agent c) Ask about local and state requirements for refuse disposal, including any special requirements for livestock killed by fire. d) Hire a professional contractor for demolition. A professional is your best bet for safe, efficient clean-up. Farm equipment and vehicles. Contact your insurance agent to ascertain coverage and decide whether restoration is feasible. Even if vehicles were not burned, heat can damage rubber, plastic, glass and paint. If farm vehicles and field equipment have sustained only minor to moderate smoke damage, specialty cleaning companies can provide steam cleaning. Smoke cannot get into sealed engines, so reconditioning usually is not a concern. For milking equipment, contact the manufacturer about clean-up and testing services. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Salvaging Food After a Fire WHAT\\'S SAFE WHEN THE WORST IS OVER Use extreme caution when trying to save food after a fire. Food and utensils damaged by heat, smoke, chemicals or water may not be safe to use. Food in cans or jars may appear to be okay. But if it has been close to the heat of the fire, it may no longer be edible. Heat from the fire can activate food spoilage bacteria or cause undesirable flavor changes. Toxic fumes can contaminate food items as well. Items stored in permeable packaging should be thrown away. If you detect an off-flavor or smell in refrigerated foods, dispose of them as well. Your family\\'s health is not worth the risk. WHEN IN DOUBT, THROW IT OUT Be thorough in inspecting kitchen items for water, smoke, chemical and heat damage. When in doubt, throw it out. Throw out any of these items if they have come in contact with waters or chemicals used in fire fighting: a) Fresh produce, meat, poultry, fish and eggs. b) Opened containers and packages. c) Containers with peel-off tops, or cork-lined, waxed cardboard or paraffin (waxed) seals. d) All food in cardboard boxes, paper, foil, plastic, cellophane or cloth. e) Spices, seasonings and extracts, flour, sugar and other staples in canisters. Throw away any items that were charred or near the fire. Heat damage may not be apparent on the outside of canned goods, but extreme heat can harm the contents. Throw them away. Throw away any raw foods stored outside the refrigerator like potatoes or fruit, which could be contaminated by fumes or chemicals. Disinfect cans that have no heat damage and are free from dents and rust. Mark contents with an indelible pen, them remove the label. Clean with detergent and scrub brush. Immerse for 10 minutes in a warm solution of chlorine bleach and water — 2 tablespoons of bleach per gallon of water. REFRIGERATION AND FREEZER CONCERNS Refrigerator and freezer seals may not be air-tight. If food has an off-smell or flavor when it is prepared, throw it out. If the electricity is out to the refrigerator or freezer, follow these guidelines: Discard refrigerated meats, seafood, milk, soft cheese, eggs, prepared foods and cookie doughs if they have been kept above 40 degrees F. for over two hours. Also discard thawed items that have warmed above 40 degrees F., with the exception of breads and plain cakes. Discard any refrigerated items that turn moldy or have an unusual odor or appearance.

Refreeze partially or completely frozen foods. Cold but fully thawed, uncooked meat, fish or poultry should be checked for off-odor. If there is none, cook and eat or cook and refreeze. Discard combination dishes such as stews, casseroles and meat pies if they are thawed. Refreeze thawed (but cold) juices, baked goods, and dairy items such as cream, cheese and butter. Do not refreeze thawed vegetables unless ice crystals remain. Cook and use them if there are no off-odors.

University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Disinfecting Dishes, Cookware and Utensils SAFETY GUIDELINES AFTER A DISASTER During a disaster such as a flood, tornado or fire, kitchen items easily can become contaminated. Floodwaters may contain silt, raw sewage, oil or chemical wastes, while fires may leave residues from toxic fumes or fire-fighting chemicals. Before using any item that has come in contact with these substances, follow the guidelines at right. Additional resources: Your county family living agent, the American Red Cross, the Federal Emergency Management Agency Related publications: “Repairing Your Flooded Home,” American Red Cross/Federal Emergency Management Agency, 1992. DISASSEMBLE, WASH AND DISINFECT Take apart any item that can be cleaned in pieces. If possible, remove handles from pots. If you have a dishwasher and the hot water temperature is at least 140 degrees F., use a long wash cycle and heated drying cycle to clean and disinfect dishwasher-safe items. Regarding other items, or all items if you don\\'t have a dishwasher, follow these steps: Wash all items in a a strong detergent solution. Use a brush to remove dirt. Rinse in hot water. Immerse glass, porcelain, china, plastic dinnerware and enamelware for 10 minutes in a disinfecting solution of 2 tablespoons of chlorine bleach per gallon of hot water. Disinfect silverware, metal utensils, and pots and pans by boiling in water for 10 minutes. Chlorine bleach should not be used in this case because it reacts with many metals and causes them to darken. Air-dry dishes. Do not use a towel. Discard and replace soft, porous plastic or wood items saturated by floodwater, since they cannot be sanitized. These include baby bottles, nipples and pacifiers. If cupboards and counters come in contact with floodwater, clean and rinse them with a chlorine bleach solution before storing dishes. Likewise, clean and disinfect surfaces affected by smoke, toxic fumes or firefighting chemicals.

In some cases, you may have a total loss; in other cases, you may be able to salvage all or part of your feed. But for the safety of your animals, either dispose of or test any suspicious feed. If you feed contaminated, moldy or otherwise damaged feed, you risk lowered production, illness or death in your animals. At the least, animals may refuse to eat feed that has been charred or has an odor. Additional resources: Your county agricultural agent, your veterinarian, forage testing laboratories Related publications: “Extinguishing Silo Fires,” (NRAES-18), Northeast Regional Agricultural Engineering Service. SILAGE Damaged silage must be unloaded because: a) Overheated silage has lost its nutritional value. b) The top layers of wet silage may spoil or be unacceptable to animals. c) Any missed hot spots may reignite. Heat damage and fire damage. Silage that has been heated above 150 degrees F. loses much of its nutritional value. Charred silage also will have little feed value; cows may not eat it, depending on taste or aroma. In some instances, cows actually eat more heat-damaged silage to try to compensate for the lost nutritional value. To determine quality of overheated silage, send it to a feed testing laboratory. Silage below the fire level will not be damaged and will not lose any nutritional value. Water damage. Silage saturated with water may mold and spoil because much of the preserving acid produced during fermentation has leached out or been diluted. The nutritional value of the saturated silage is reduced and the cows may refuse to eat it. Consider spreading it on land as a fertilizer. GRAIN AND HAY Debris. Be aware that metal, lead paint, nails from the roof or other debris may have fallen into the feed during firefighting. Disposing of grain may be your best option if debris has compromised the feed. Darkened or burned feed. These have been oxidized and, therefore, nutritional value has been reduced. Animals most likely won\\'t eat these feeds. Dispose of them or spread them on fields as fertilizer. Wet feeds. It may be difficult or impossible to dry wet grain or hay naturally. If these feeds are readily available and clean (no chance of chemical contamination or fire-fighting debris), feed them to livestock. Recognize that wet feeds may have only a few days of “shelf life” before spoilage occurs. Otherwise, spread them on fields as fertilizer or dispose of them. Baled hay. Small quantities may be dried naturally if broken apart. Larger quantities are generally a loss because of the difficulty of drying. Hay quickly spoils when wet—and moldy hay may be dangerously toxic to animals. If possible, spread hay on fields as a fertilizer or dispose of it. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Northeast Regional Agricultural Engineering Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension FIRE-HOME/FARM RECOVERY Salvaging Farm Buildings After a Fire ASSESSING DAMAGE AND OPTIONS FOR REBUILDING Before trying to salvage a structure after a fire, assess the true worth of what remains after fire, heat, smoke and water damage. The true worth will be higher if the structure can be effectively used as part of a reconstructed facility. An engineer or experienced contractor can help you assess true worth. These experts can also help you consider options for reconstruction or new construction. Insurance coverage and other assets will probably be the final factor in your decision-making. INSPECT EXISTING MATERIALS Fiberglass and blown-in insulation. If insulation has gotten wet, it will have to be removed and replaced with dry materials. If wall surfaces must be replaced in the process, consider upgrading wiring and plumbing at this time. Steel. When exposed to intense heat, steel loses its strength and any surface-applied corrosion protection. Steel beams cannot be relied upon to support loads for which they were originally designed. Replace these members if exposed to extreme heat to assure structural integrity of the building. Metal roofing and siding. Both rely on protective layers of galvanizing and/or paint to protect corrosion. Plan to replace these materials if exposed to heat, even if they were not in direct contact with flames. Wood. Light charring of wood will not significantly affect its strength. Replace wooden supports which have been deeply burned. Metal truss plates. Many roof trusses are fabricated with metal truss plates. The metal truss plates may lose more strength in a fire than the adjoining wood supports. Use a reliable contractor or engineer to determine the extent of damage at these critical joints. Concrete and mortar. These materials will flake off and/or turn to powder when exposed to heat. The thickness of the damaged concrete will be determined by the intensity and duration of heat exposure. Tap concrete with a hammer to test its integrity. A dull thud implies heat damage. A ringing sound means the concrete may be in reasonable condition. SALVAGING EXISTING STRUCTURES Once the value of the remaining structure is established, assess how the remnants can be rebuilt to meet your current and future needs. This is a good opportunity to consider updating or upgrading of facilities. For example: Livestock buildings. Consider livestock resting, water and feeding space needs; update ventilation, preferably using natural ventilation; install moisture-proof wiring and an equipotential plane to protect against stray voltage; install freeze-protected water systems; consider animal traffic and manure handling. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension FIRE-HOME/FARM RECOVERY more information Additional resources: Your county agricultural agent, Midwest Plan Service Related publications: UW-Extension publications– “Contracting for Agricultural Construction,” (A3490); “Farmstead Planning—Zoning and Regulations Checklist,” (A2725). Northeast Regional Agricultural Engineering Service publication,“Fire Control in Livestock Buildings.” Milking facilities. Consider a milking parlor or flat barn milking system; upgrade wiring and equipotential plane; improve lighting and ventilation; upgrade milking equipment and energy-conserving devices, such as air injectors, bulk tank heat exchangers and well-water precoolers. Silos. Consider horizontal feed storage for its improved rate of filling and emptying and lower cost of construction and operation; size new silos according to daily feeding needs. Storage sheds. Consider access doors; consider a shop; use proper wiring design and installation; consider size of items to be stored; consider separate pesticide storage. BUILDING NEW STRUCTURES If the remnants cannot be economically reworked to satisfy your needs, consider building a totally new structure. Be especially critical of the remnants when making this assessment. Consider: Location. Locate animal structures so odors blow away from the house and neighbors\\' houses; locate to take advantage of wind for natural ventilation in livestock buildings; consider space needs for future structures. Drainage. Locate on high ground to shed water from the site and to avoid flooding from upland areas. Traffic patterns. Consider how equipment, animals, feed, grain and manure will be routed around the farm. Current size of structure and future expansion needs. Develop a farmstead drawing of how your farmstead will look in 10 to 20 years. Expense. Before deciding on a final option, consider the economics of several options. Make your decisions based on lower annual cost options — not the lowest initial investment; consider your long-term needs when making a short-term decision. FIRE CONTROL MEASURES Be sure all new construction features fire-retardant material and design concepts that result in fire safety. Early warning devices such as smoke detectors and heat detectors should be part of new designs, as well as ventilation systems that shut down during a fire. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension c o m m u n i t y / f a m i l y i s s u e s Insurance Coverage and Making a Claim WHAT TO DO BEFORE AND AFTER A DISASTER With the exception of flooding damage, most losses due to natural disasters are covered by homeowner\\'s insurance. Still, few policies cover the cost of all damages. Study your policy and talk with your agent about additional coverage before disaster strikes. Find out whether claims are paid on the basis of replacement cost or current market value, and whether reimbursement covers total replacement cost or a given percentage of the replacement cost. Contact your insurance agent immediately after a disaster. Planning ahead and having the agent\\'s phone number and your policy number will expedite the process. It also helps to have a written and photo or video inventory of personal property. Finally, check with your local emergency government office about disaster rehabilitation assistance. Some disaster assistance may be available for expenses not covered by your insurance policy. (See the fact sheet, “Disaster Rehabilitation Assistance.”) TYPES OF INSURANCE Many types of insurance may come into play during disaster recovery. If injuries or loss of life occurred, these will extend to health insurance, disability and life insurance. Clean-up and repair of your home and other property involve the following insurance types: Homeowner\\'s and renter\\'s insurance. In general, property insurance will include some coverage for “fire or lightning damage,” and/or “wind and hail damage,” which includes some of the typical damage from tornadoes and hurricanes. Most policies cover damage from water or water blowing in only if an opening to the structure sustains damage. Some may cover basement flooding caused by sewer backup or sump pump failure. Damage from surface water — as in floor or “rising water” damage — is not covered in the usual private policy. You must purchase special flood insurance for this coverage (see next bulleted item). A homeowner\\'s policy will include several other elements as well, such as liability insurance for injuries or damages caused by you, a member of your family or a pet. Flood Insurance. Unless you specifically purchase flood insurance, your homeowner\\'s policy does not insure you against losses caused by flooding. Most communities in Wisconsin participate in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), under which you can buy federally-subsidized flood insurance at a reasonable cost. If your community participates, any owner or occupant of insurable property may buy a policy from a licensed insurance agent or broker, or directly from the NFIP. Buildings and their contents can be insured against flood loss; all direct losses by flood are covered. Your insurance agent, zoning administrator or other local official can tell you if your community participates in the NFIP. For routine policy rating or customer service inquiries, call the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which administers the program, at (800) 638-6620. Automobile insurance. Study your policy to determine the extent of your current coverage. Comprehensive insurance covers damage to your car from various natural disasters. Coverage includes flood, fire, smoke, wind, hail, glass breakage, vandalism, theft and collision with animals. Auto liability insurance is protection against the cost of defending yourself if you are sued for injury or damage caused by your car. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension COMMUNITY/FAMILY ISSUES-FAMILY FINANCES more information SETTLING YOUR CLAIM Do not settle your claim until: A thorough inspection of the property has been completed by an insurance adjuster and repair contractor. Estimates for all damages have been prepared and you fully understand them. You, your insurance adjuster and contractor should agree on needed repairs and estimates. Advance insurance payments have been calculated, deductibles have been applied and you know the total amount of your settlement. You have identified damaged items you are keeping and agree with salvage deductions. You have identified any items that won\\'t be repaired, but for which you will be paid an “appearance loss” (for example, hail-damaged siding). You and your contractor understand any time limits for repairs, as required by the insurance company. (Extensions usually can be granted with advance notice.) Additional resources: Your county family living agent, your insurance agent, the State Floodplain Management Program of the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the Federal Emergency Management Agency MAKING AN INSURANCE CLAIM Contact your insurance agent and report the damage. Give your name, address, policy number, and the date and time of loss. The sooner you talk to an agent, the sooner your claim will be filed and an adjuster will look at your damage. Ask when the adjuster will visit. Protect your property from further damage or theft. Patch roofs temporarily. Cover broken windows with boards or plastic. If household furnishings are exposed to the weather, move them to a safe location for storage. Take pictures of the damage beforehand if possible. Keep accurate records: a) A list of all cleaning and repair bills, including materials, cost of rental equipment and depreciation of purchase equipment. b) A list of all disaster-related living expenses, including motel and restaurant bills, home rental and car rental. c) A list of all actual losses, including furniture, appliances, clothing, paintings, artifacts, food and equipment, regardless of your intent to replace the objects. Try to document the value of each object lost. Written and videotaped household inventories, bills of sale, canceled checks, charge account records and insurance evaluations are good evidence. If you do not have such records, estimate the value and give purchase place and date of purchase. d) Photographs of damaged property. Pictures also can be used as evidence for tax deductions. Contact a reputable and well-established firm or individual to have your damage repaired. Sometimes undependable workers enter a damaged area, make cheap repairs and leave before residents discover that repairs are inadequate. Get recommendations and written contracts for the work. Don\\'t be in a hurry to settle your claim. Often, people are so anxious to have their home restored after a disaster, they sign off on a settlement before damages are fully discovered or repair costs fully understood. (See sidebar at left.) Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Wisconsin Division of Emergency Government, Wisconsin Office of the Insurance Commissioner, North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Disaster Rehabilitation Assistance GRANTS, LOANS AND HOW TO APPLY A variety of disaster assistance is available to homeowners, farmers and businesses with property damage. Lending agencies make loans for home repair, improvement, land equipment and livestock. Federal and state assistance may be available if your community is declared a disaster area by your governor, a federal agency director or the president. Local government and media will keep you informed about disaster declarations and where to get information about any programs. If your area is declared a major disaster area, one or more Disaster Application Centers (DACs) may open to provide information and take applications for assistance. They usually are located in a school or other public building. While low-interest loans and cost-share programs can be very attractive, be sure you carefully analyze the impact of additional borrowing on your household, farm or business before you undertake any new obligations. HOME AND PERSONAL PROPERTY During times of disaster, the Small Business Administration (SBA) offers medium- and long-term loans for rehabilitation of homes and personal property. Interest rates are relatively low. Two loan types: a) Small Business Administration (SBA) Personal Property Loans: For the repair and replacement of personal items such as clothing, furniture and automobiles. b) SBA Real Property Loans: To repair or restore a primary home to its pre-disaster condition. If you are required by local government to make structural improvements or relocate, these costs may be included in a loan. Federal Emergency Management Agency assistance. If you are denied an SBA loan, you may be eligible for a FEMA grant, which is administered by the state. Your community may also apply for funding under the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, which covers acquisition and relocation expenses for homeowners in flood-prone areas, as well as flood-proofing. See your local or state emergency government office about participation and any restrictions. Private lenders. You may be eligible for loans from your local bank or credit union. Historical societies. Check with your local historical society about loan or grant programs available for architecturally significant properties. BUSINESS Small Business Association (SBA) Physical Disaster Business Loans: To repair and/or flood-proof buildings and remove debris for small businesses. SBA Economic Disaster Business Loans: To permit small businesses to meet the financial obligations they would have made, had the disaster not occurred. HUD Community Development Block Grants: May cover relocation or flood-proofing of business properties as part of a larger community development plan. Grants are funded through the federal Housing and Urban Development agency. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension COMMUNITY/FAMILY ISSUES-FAMILY FINANCES more information OTHER ASSISTANCE Insurance, volunteer organizations and businesses are three other important sources of assistance for disaster survivors. If you are fully insured, you may only have to pay the deductible and your insurance policy will pay for professional cleaning and reconstruction. The same is true for flood Insurance, which may be purchased in most Wisconsin communities through the National Flood Insurance Program. Meet with local emergency government officials about current options and funding sources related to flood-proofing or relocation. Private volunteer organizations, such as the American Red Cross, the Salvation Army and church groups, usually are on the scene during or after a disaster. These groups help with clothing, groceries, shelter, medical aid, counseling and, in some cases, clean-up and rebuilding supplies. Services often are supplied free of charge. Your local TV, radio and newspapers usually publicize ways that businesses are contributing to the recovery process. Some businesses may offer reduced prices, but you should be wary of “flood sales” of flood-damaged items. Additional resources Your county emergency government office, the Wisconsin Division of Emergency Government, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the American Red Cross, your county family living agent FARM Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service (ASCS) Federal Farm Disaster Assistance: To help with crop loss, feed assistance, farmland rehabilitation and lack of feed. Prior approval is required and specifications are subject to change. Farmer\\'s Home Administration Emergency Loan Program: For damaged property, production costs associated with disaster, family living expenses, etc. Successful applicants must be credit worthy, but may already have been turned down by another lender. Farm Bureau and other farm organizations: Check with disaster relief officials or your local county Extension office. Merchants and dealers: May, if requested, extend credit for feed, equipment and rehabilitation of buildings and land. INFRASTRUCTURE ASSISTANCE FEMA Public Assistance Program. Financial assistance may be available to communities for disaster-related expenses, such as debris clearance, restoration and repair of buildings, roads, water facilities and utilities owned by state and local governments. Assistance also may be available to private, nonprofit organizations. APPLYING FOR GRANTS AND LOANS What you\\'ll need for most grants or loans: An itemized list of losses with your estimate of the repair or replacement cost of each item. Copies of your federal income tax returns from the last three years. Copy of your deed, mortgage or renter\\'s lease. Estimates of new flood insurance premiums; copies of your previous insurance policy or insurance settlement. For personal loss: Proof of monthly income (stubs, statements). Driver\\'s license and/or Social Security number. Business or farm loss: A brief history of the business or farm. Personal and business financial statements. Loan repayment schedule; list of bills owed. Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service information on farm crop base and assigned yields. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, University of Illinois Cooperative Extension Service, University of Missouri Cooperative Extension, American Red Cross, Federal Emergency Management Agency University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Surviving a Financial State of Emergency STRATEGIES FOR FAMILIES AFTER A DISASTER Disasters can create serious financial crises for families. Insurance may not cover as much as anticipated. Homes and jobs may be lost. Family members may be out of work due to injuries. In an ideal world, families have adequate cash reserves or credit to draw on for disasters. But reality is often far from ideal. Making decisions about repairs and purchases, and developing resources to maintain your home can be difficult. However, some basic financial tools and household saving strategies can help you survive an emergency. In some cases, you may be able to make ends meet by making changes in the way money is handled every day. FINANCIAL TOOLS Cut back on current spending as much as possible. Use cash reserves if you have them. When the emergency passes, rebuild your reserves. Use unsecured credit, such as a credit card, but use it wisely. Whenever possible, pay your balance in full to avoid finance charges. If you know that you will need several months to repay, consider taking out a loan rather than charging things on a credit card. Finance charges are likely to be lower for the loan than for the credit card. If you think you will be late making payments or you if have missed payments, contact your creditors immediately to make special arrangements. Borrow against your assets. If your home survived the disaster, you may be able to borrow against a portion of the equity through refinancing, a second mortgage or a home equity line of credit. Or you may be able to borrow against your equity in an employee pension plan or whole life insurance policy. Liquidate assets. You may want to consider selling major assets to generate cash. This will require making some difficult decisions about your priorities. Discuss options for reducing interest charges on outstanding loans with your creditors. LOOK FOR WAYS TO SAVE Look at each monthly bill to see if you can make reductions and still keep the item or service. Telephone bills are a good place to start, especially if you have additional services that could be dropped temporarily, such as a second line or call waiting. Try lowering long distance charges by making fewer calls, shorter calls or calling when rates are lowest. Examine bills for cable TV, electricity, water and car maintenance for places to save. Utilities, such as the electric company, will help you with ideas to reduce costs, including use of balanced billing plans to even out expenses. Talk to insurance agents about ways to reduce costs. In some cases, deductibles can be raised, coverage lowered, life insurance converted to lower cost plans, or life insurance on children discontinued.

Consider bartering. If you need repairs done in your home, consider exchanging your skills for the repair service you need. Some communities have bartering networks and groups, but you may be able to barter with a relative, neighbor or friend. Some examples are exchanging wallpapering for lawn mowing, fixing leaks for car repair, resume preparation for appliance repair. LOOK FOR WAYS TO DO WITHOUT What things could you do without for a few months? Consider such overlooked expenses as newspaper or magazine subscriptions, hair care and/or beauty treatments, clothing, classes or lessons, sports leagues, nights out, vending machine snacks or buying meals at work. Learn nice ways to say no. It may be to a salesperson on the phone, a friend asking to do something that costs more than you care to pay, or a child saying, “Everybody has one.” Some easy ways of saying no are: a) “That\\'s something we\\'ve decided not to buy right now.” b) “That\\'s a great price, (product, offer, idea) but I\\'m afraid I have to pass for now.” c) “Let me think about it.” To children, suggest, “That\\'s something you can buy with your allowance,” or “Let\\'s think of some ways for you to earn or save the money to buy it.” Shop less often and with a written list. Time spent in stores encourages spending money, especially when shopping trips are not essential. Take only as much cash as you can reasonably spend. Don\\'t carry credit cards or ATM cards. Look for alternatives to making new major purchases. Borrow an appliance from a family member or friend. Or buy an inexpensive used model through the newspaper, a friend or a garage sale. ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF INCOME If physical damage to your home was minor, you might consider temporary room rental as an additional source of income. Be sure your local regulations and zoning laws permit room rental. Garage sales may be a good way to bring in extra cash if you have undamaged items that you no longer need. Consider a cooperative garage sale with family, friends or neighbors. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Iowa State University Extension, University of Florida Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Restructuring Debt After a Disaster ESTABLISHING PRIORITIES AND ADJUSTING DEBT You are obligated to pay all of your creditors, even after a disaster has shaken your financial status. However, debt adjustments can ease a difficult financial period by reducing the amount paid to creditors, or extending the time period for payments. Before contacting creditors, take a hard look at your finances and evaluate how much and when you can pay. Consider: Your monthly income Essential monthly living expenses Number of creditors and total amount owed How long your present financial circumstances will last Assets (savings, items that could be sold) that could help pay off loans High-priority debts Debts that could be satisfied by voluntarily surrendering, or giving back, an item DECIDING WHICH DEBTS TO PAY FIRST If you can\\'t pay all your bills, you must decide how much to pay to which creditors. One way is to divide available money and pay every creditor a share of what you owe. This is probably the fairest way, but it doesn\\'t always work because each creditor must agree to reduce the amount they receive and extend the payment period. Another creditor payment strategy involves setting priorities. Ask yourself these questions: What will affect my family\\'s health and security the most? Usually the house, utilities, food, transportation and medical insurance take priority. Don\\'t be tempted to let medical insurance slide when money is tight. If anyone in your family becomes ill, uninsured medical costs could be devastating. Pay high-priority bills or contact creditors at once to work out smaller payments. What will we lose if the bills aren\\'t paid? You can lose your purchases if the creditor holds the title of the property as security for the loan: a home mortgage or car loan, for example. Sometimes furniture and large appliance loans are secured loans. If you aren\\'t sure which loans are secured, check the credit contract. Unsecured debts may have to take lower priority, although you are obligated to pay them too. How much do we still owe on the loan? Determine how much you have paid on each loan and how much you owe. If you have only one or two payments to make on a loan, it\\'s probably a good idea to finish paying it. Getting out from under some of your debts can reduce the pressure you feel. You may be able to return newer items or sell them to pay off the debt. If you choose to voluntarily surrender an item, you\\'ll still be required to pay the difference between its market value and the amount remaining on the loan. What interest rate are we paying? Credit card firms charging 1.5% interest per month would receive 18% interest per year on the unpaid balances. If you have a loan with a lower interest rate, you may decide to pay off a higher interest credit card balance first, to reduce the amount of finance charges you are paying. Until your financial situation improves, watch credit card purchases carefully. Consider putting cards away in a safe place so you are not tempted to use them. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension COMMUNITY/FAMILY ISSUES-FAMILY FINANCES more information MAKING IT WORK Remember — no matter how bad your situation may be, don\\'t ignore your bills and creditors. Prompt action is very important; let your creditors know you are having trouble before you miss payments and the situation becomes worse. Once you have worked out a repayment plan, follow through with it and make the payments you promised to make. If you fall behind on your new commitments, creditors will be less understanding. If you fail to make the payments, creditors may hire a collection agency to make you pay. Openly discuss spending decisions with all family members. This will help everyone realize that changes and sacrifices must be made for your family\\'s plan to be successful. Additional resources: Your county family living agent, your local emergency government office, the American Red Cross, the Federal Emergency Management Agency Related publications: UW-Extension publications– “Managing Between Jobs — Deciding Which Bills to Pay First, (B3459-3); “Managing Between Jobs — Strategies for Spending less,” (B3459-2); “Managing Between Jobs — Talking with Creditors,” (B3459-4); “Making Ends Meet: Our Spending Plan,” (B7760313). Is consolidation a good idea? Personal finance companies want you to think so, but generally a consolidation loan charges a higher interest rate, often 20% or more. And refinancing to smaller monthly payments will extend the number of payments you must make, adding to the total cost. If you are facing a temporary financial crisis because of disaster, the ease of a single payment may be worth the higher interest rate if you can pay back the loan early with no penalty. What about our credit record? Nonpayment of debts is recorded on your credit record and can damage your ability to get credit in the future. That\\'s why you should contact all of your creditors immediately if you cannot pay your bills. YOUR REPAYMENT PLAN Once you have calculated how much money your family has for monthly living expenses and for paying off debts: Decide how much you can pay to each creditor, based on priorities you determined while answering the previous questions. Work out a repayment plan that shows how much you plan to pay each creditor. Put this plan in writing. Contact each of your creditors to explain your family situation. You will need to tell them how much you are able to pay and when you will be able to pay it. (See the fact sheet, “Communicating With Creditors,” in this series.) Some businesses, such as utility companies, have counselors to help you budget even payments during the year. They also can tell you if you qualify for fuel assistance or any available programs. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, University of Illinois Cooperative Extension Service, University of Florida Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Communicating With Creditors WHEN YOU FACE MISSING PAYMENTS AFTER A DISASTER After a natural disaster, you may face temporary loss of income and steep bills for clean-up and repair not covered by insurance. If you realize you can\\'t pay all your bills, it is important to face your debts and know how to talk to creditors. Your past experiences with creditors are important. If you have consistently paid bills when due, your creditors will be more cooperative than if you were late or didn\\'t make regular payments. Creditors want to keep your business, but as businesses they also need to be paid. Contact your creditors immediately; don\\'t wait for them to contact you. Explain your current situation. Tell them your family income is reduced and you are not able to keep up with your payments. Frankly discuss your future income prospects so you and your creditors can figure out solutions to the problem. Most creditors would prefer to receive smaller payments on a regular basis than to begin expensive collection procedures. WHERE TO BEGIN Before you and your creditors agree on a reduced payment or some other solution, determine how much money you have to pay off your debts. Figure out how much income you can count on each month and how much you need to pay for your essential monthly living expenses. Once you have gathered this information, contact each creditor explaining your family\\'s situation and work out a solution. Be prepared to explain: The reason you cannot pay. Your current income and prospects for future income. Other obligations. Your plans to bring this debt up-to-date and keep it current, including the amount you will be able to pay each month. Visit local creditors in person. Contact out-of-town creditors by phone or letter. If you phone, write down the name and title of the person to whom you talked. Follow the conversation with a letter summarizing the agreement between you and the creditor. Keep copies of your correspondence as well as any replies. As you negotiate with each of your creditors, don\\'t agree to any loan simply to get off the hook. Be sure you will be able to follow through on the agreement. Establish a payment rate that is realistic and acceptable to both you and the creditor. RENEGOTIATION OPTIONS Here are some alternatives to consider when negotiating with your creditors: Reducing the monthly payment Refinancing the loan Consolidating your loans Deferring a payment for a short time if you expect your income will increase soon Reducing or dropping late charges Paying only interest on the loan until you can resume making monthly payments University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension COMMUNITY/FAMILY ISSUES-FAMILY FINANCES more information WHEN THEY CALL… If you receive a call from a creditor or a collection agency: Ask the name of the caller. Get the name of the creditor and the name, address and telephone number of the collection agency. Get the exact amount of the account that is claimed to be due. Write down the date and time of each call. Don\\'t get angry. Remain calm in order to obtain the information noted above. Dispute debts in writing. If you believe you do not owe the amount claimed or disagree in other ways, make your reasons known promptly in writing to both the creditor and the collection agency. Request a written statement of your account.

Voluntarily surrendering or giving back an item purchased on credit Selling the item and using the cash to satisfy, or partially satisfy, the debt (you are still responsible for any remaining balance) Not all creditors will be willing to accept alternatives. However, they will be more likely to work with your family if you contact them before they contact you. If you fail to follow the plan that you and your creditor agreed upon, you may hurt your chances of getting future credit. Tell your creditors about anticipated changes that may affect your payment agreement. IF YOU DON\\'T PAY YOUR BILLS If you miss a payment, you will face increasing pressure to pay. First you will receive a letter reminding you that you missed a payment and asking you to pay promptly. After that, you may receive a more direct letter demanding payment, or you may get a phone call. If the bills are still not paid, they will probably be turned over to an independent collection agency. CREDITOR\\'S OPTIONS Creditors can take several kinds of legal action against you if you fail to make payments: Acceleration. The entire debt is payable at once if you miss a payment. The courts can force you to pay by seizing your property and selling it. Repossession. The creditor can seize the item you bought or the property you used as collateral. If the sale of the property brings less than the amount you owe, you must pay the difference. Wage garnishment. A court order requires your employer to withhold part of your wages and pay your creditor. Foreclosure. The lender may start proceedings to take possession of your home/business and sell it to recover the remaining balance of the loan. You are responsible for the legal fees of foreclosure and the difference between the selling price of the property and the amount owed on the loan. All of these actions are very serious and could jeopardize your ability to get credit in the future. To avoid such problems, work out solutions for debt repayment early and stick with the plan unless it is renegotiated. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, University of Illinois Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Talking as a Family About Money OPENING UP COMMUNICATION AFTER A DISASTER No matter what damage a disaster leaves in its wake, the common denominator is often a money crunch. While money problems may seem too painful to discuss, they may only get worse if you don\\'t talk about them. Overcoming financial difficulties takes honest and candid communication. It also takes time and effort. Coming together as a family can help members, both young and old, work together to get through the difficult times. Children who are included in family decisions usually welcome the opportunity to figure out how they can contribute. Even a 4-year-old can help turn off lights to save on energy costs.

GATHER AS A FAMILY When families work on financial issues together, the result is often new solutions and a new appreciation for the strengths and resources each member has to offer. Here are a few guidelines: Family members, including children old enough to understand, should be involved in decisions. Family members will be more satisfied with decisions if they have input. Remember that disasters bring with them a range of emotions. Each of you may be at different stages in dealing with losses and new hardships. Try to be calm, patient and supportive of one another. Set a specific time to have a family discussion. Choose a location where you won\\'t be interrupted. Clearly identify the issue at hand. Don\\'t drag other points into the discussion that don\\'t address the problem, concern or dissatisfaction. Let each family member freely state his or her wants, needs and personal feelings. Avoid judging or criticizing. Be willing to negotiate for a realistic settlement of differences. In many cases, family members must compromise. Making a contract or written agreement may help avoid misunderstandings. Solutions also can be accepted on a trial basis, and changed if the results aren\\'t satisfactory. ONE THING AT A TIME As a family, focus on ways to tackle one problem area at a time. During one gathering you might talk about ways the family can spend less money. At another session, tackle methods for record keeping as a way to control spending. When discussing new purchases or services, ask: Can we do without it? Can we postpone it? Can we substitute something less expensive? Can we shop around for a better deal? Can we make or do it ourselves? Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Iowa State University Extension, University of Florida Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension COMMUNITY/FAMILY ISSUES-FAMILY FINANCES Talking to Children About Money GUIDELINES FOR PARENTS AFTER A DISASTER Disaster-related financial stress can take a toll on young children, especially when parents are busy with day-to-day recovery and clean-up. While children\\'s complaints may seem trivial in light of other problems at home, they often signal the need to talk about why the family must cut spending. Each family has to decide how much to tell their children about the family\\'s financial situation. If children know how the family stands financially, they can better cooperate with the family spending plan. They also can better handle their own money. Additional resources: Your county family living agent, your local emergency government office, the American Red Cross, the Federal Emergency Management Agency Related publications: UW-Extension publications– “Managing Between Jobs — Deciding Which Bills to Pay First,” (B3459-3); “Managing Between Jobs — Strategies for Spending less,” (B3459-2); “Managing Between Jobs — Talking with Creditors,” (B3459-4); “Making Ends Meet: Our Spending Plan,” (B7760313). GET CHILDREN INVOLVED Children can\\'t help but be affected when the family cuts back on spending. So it makes sense that they are included in discussions about changes that will affect them. Have family meetings to talk about money concerns. a) Offer information that children can understand without overwhelming them. b) Encourage children to discuss their personal feelings and suggestions for handling the crisis. c) Avoid judging and criticizing. Explain financial issues in terms your children can understand. For example, you can tell your daughter that you aren\\'t spending $100 to buy a new video game system because that same $100 is needed for family groceries. Help children learn they can\\'t buy everything they want, and that there is a difference between what they want and what they need. Find ways that your children can help the family cut expenses. Children can learn to comparison shop if parents point out unit prices, store brands and generic brands. At home, they can help compare prices in advertising flyers from different stores. Even young children can learn to turn off lights and appliances to save on energy costs. Older children can choose “free” activities with their friends, like going for a bike ride or to a park or library, rather than going places where money is needed, like a shopping center, video arcade or roller skating rink. Refer to your family as a team. Agree that together you can get through these tough financial times. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Iowa State University Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension COMMUNITY/FAMILY ISSUES-FAMILY FINANCES Income Tax Deductions For Property Loss STEPS TO TAKE AFTER A DISASTER Property losses from natural disaster are tax deductible. Such deductions, which are allowed for partial or total loss of personal or business property, could greatly reduce the amount of federal income taxes owed for the year the disaster occurred. RECORDS If you claim a theft or casualty loss resulting from a disaster you may be asked to show: The kind of disaster and when it occurred; That the damage was a direct result of the disaster; That you were the owner of the property; Your income tax basis in the property. In general, this is the original cost of the property plus the cost of any improvements before the loss, minus depreciation claimed for income tax purposes (for business and rental property); Fair market value before and after the disaster; Any insurance benefits or other compensation received including free repairs, restoration and clean-up from any disaster relief agencies. Before-and-after photographs, receipts, canceled checks, deeds, purchase contracts and professional appraisals are good supporting evidence for casualty claims. APPRAISAL If either personal or business property has been damaged extensively, you should have the property appraised as soon as possible following the disaster. A professional estimate of value will serve as evidence for casualty loss claims. The fee charged is also a deductible item. ITEMIZING TAX DEDUCTIONS If you itemize your tax deductions, you may deduct casualty losses from fire, storm, theft or property destroyed by some sudden external force. However, you must reduce the deduction by any reimbursements or payments received to rebuild or restore property. Specifically, homeowners can claim a casualty loss deduction for the difference between the fair market value of their property before the disaster and after, subtracting insurance proceeds (or other reimbursements they receive to rebuild or restore a home), 10 percent of adjusted gross income and $100 per disaster event. To document the before- and after-market value of your home, use the most recent assessed value from property taxes for the before-disaster market value and a current appraisal for the after-disaster market value.

Grants or other gifts that are specifically designed to repair or replace property must be deducted as well. Homeowners who haven\\'t received a reimbursement, but expect to, will be required to make an estimate of the reimbursement and subtract it. Those who find they overestimated their reimbursements can amend their casualty loss claim in another tax year. HOW TO FIGURE DEDUCTIONS The rules for figuring deductions on business or non-business property losses are the same. Subtract the reduced market value after the disaster from the fair market value before the disaster. For example, on personal property: Fair market value before $75,000 Fair market value after 30,000 Reduction in value 45,000 (Line 1 minus Line 2) Income tax basis 55,000 (the original cost of property, $40,000, plus the cost of any pre-disaster improvements, $15,000) Casualty loss $45,000 (lesser of Line 3 or 4) The casualty loss deduction is the lesser of the reduction in value or the income tax basis. In the above example, the casualty loss deduction would be $45,000. If a business or income-producing property is completely destroyed by a casualty, special rules apply. In such cases, the loss is the income tax basis reduced by any salvage value, insurance or other compensation. If insurance is more than the income tax basis, a taxable gain results. For more details, contact your local tax representative for advice on figuring these tax loss deductions. To file for casualty loss, use IRS Tax Form 4684 and request an instruction sheet.

Temporary homelessness, damaged personal items, lost crops and an uncertain future weigh heavily on survivors. Unfortunately, the need to talk about one\\'s losses, fears and anxieties may be forgotten in the wake of clean-up efforts. Mental health professionals have identified a number of post-disaster phases that survivors may experience, as well as guidelines for managing disaster-related stress. The most common coping tools are our abilities to listen, talk and actively support one another during this time. PHASES OF DISASTER It is important to recognize the emotional phases we may experience after disaster. There is often overlap between phases. Historic phase. This period usually occurs at the time of impact and in the period immediately after. Emotions are strong and direct. People find themselves being called upon and responding to demands for heroic action to save their own and others\\' lives and property. Altruism is prominent, and people expend major energy in helping others survive and recover. The most important resources during this phase are family groups, neighbors and emergency teams of various sorts. Honeymoon phase. This period generally extends from one week to six months after the disaster. For survivors, even with the loss of loved ones and possessions, there is a strong sense of having shared with others a dangerous, catastrophic experience and having lived through it. Supported and often encouraged by the influx of official and governmental staff who promise many kinds of help, the victims begin clean-up. There is anticipation that more help soon will be available. Pre-existing community groups and emergency community groups are especially important resources during this period. Disillusionment phase. This phase generally lasts from about two months to one or even two or more years. Strong feelings of disappointment, anger, resentment and bitterness may appear if failures occur and the promises of aid are not fulfilled. Outside agencies may need to leave, and some of the local community groups may weaken. Also contributing to this stage may be the gradual loss of the feeling of “shared community” as victims concentrate on rebuilding their own lives and solving their individual problems. Reconstruction phase. The survivors come to realize they will need to solve the problems of rebuilding their own homes, businesses, farms and lives largely by themselves and gradually assume responsibility for the tasks. This phase generally lasts for several years after the disaster. The appearance of new buildings replacing old ones, the beginnings of new construction and the development of new programs and plans all serve to reaffirm residents\\' belief in their community and their own capabilities. If these signs of progress are delayed, however, the emotional problems that appear may be serious and intense. Community groups with a longer-term investment in the community and its people become key players during this phase.

COPING SKILLS Let people give you a hand. Take advantage of people who are willing and able to help. Volunteers may be available for sand-bagging or clean-up of debris. Relief agencies may offer food and cleaning supplies. The additional help can make a critical difference between coping and suffering. Take care of your physical and emotional needs. a) See that you and your family members eat a balanced diet to fuel your energy. b) Try to get enough sleep. Fatigue slows you down during an emergency and makes you prone to accidents and injury. c) Talk with others about your feelings and listen to theirs. Together, look for positives in the situation. Be patient with one another. Realize that when we suffer losses, it is natural to express disbelief, anger, sadness, anxiety and depression afterwards. Emotions will rollercoaster and moods can change suddenly. Spouses\\' viewpoints may vary considerably. Don\\'t overlook the feelings of children as you deal with the disaster. They need to feel they can count on you for extra attention, love and support. Reassure them, making sure they understand they are not responsible for the problems you face (See fact sheet, “Helping Your Child Cope With Disaster”). Refocus on the big picture, instead of little details and the little problems. Don\\'t expect things to instantly restore themselves. Remember that a support network is essential. In addition to family members and friends, you may wish to speak with clergy members and professional counselors. In some cases, you may need to refer a family member or friend for help (See fact sheet, “Identifying Stress in Family or Others”). Show by words and actions that you care. A friendly arm around troubled shoulders or a few words of support can help tremendously. Offer specific types of help or ask how you can help. Don\\'t be afraid of saying or doing the wrong thing. And keep helping. Even small, kind deeds will mean a lot to others. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Iowa State University Cooperative Extension Service, Kansas State University Cooperative Extension Service, University of Illinois Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Identifying Stress in Family and Others WHEN OUTSIDE HELP IS NEEDED AFTER A DISASTER A feeling of helplessness is a normal reaction to a disaster. Personal coping methods like talking things out, accepting comfort and help from others, and taking things one day at a time help most people through the rough times. But when those methods fail, outside help may be needed. If you notice the warning signs of severe stress in a family member, neighbor or a friend, there are some things you can do. SIGNS OF PROLONGED STRESS When families or individuals are under stress for long periods of time they may experience a number of signs and symptoms. Watch for the following effects in people you see on a day-to-day basis. Physical. Headaches, ulcers, backaches, eating irregularities, sleep disturbances, frequent sickness, exhaustion. Emotional. Sadness, depression, bitterness, anger, anxiety, loss of spirit, loss of humor. Behavioral. Irritability, backbiting, acting out, withdrawal, passive-aggressiveness, alcoholism, violence. Cognitive. Memory loss, lack of concentration, inability to make decisions. Self-esteem. Comments such as, “I\\'m a failure,” “I blew it,” “Why can\\'t I...?” CRIES FOR HELP The greater the number of signs or symptoms, the greater your concern should be. If someone is exhibiting the following signs of depression or suicide, it is important they get linked up with help as soon as possible. All cries for help should be taken seriously. Signs of depression: Appearance. Sad face, slow movements, lack of interest in appearance. Unhappy feelings. Feeling sad, hopeless, discouraged, listless. Negative thoughts. “I\\'m a failure.” “I\\'m no good,” “No one cares.” Reduced activity. “Doing anything is just too much of an effort.” Isolation. “I don\\'t want anyone to see me,” “I feel so lonely.” Guilt and low self-esteem. “It\\'s all my fault,” “I should be punished.” Signs of suicidal intent: Anxiety or depression. Severe, intense feelings of anxiety or depression. Withdrawal or isolation. Withdrawn, alone, lack of friends or supports. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension COMMUNITY/FAMILY ISSUES-STRESS MANAGEMENT more information MAKING A REFERRAL Call the agency and ask to speak to the intake worker (if there is one). Identify yourself and your relationship with the person or family. State what you think the person\\'s or family\\'s needs are (immediate protection from suicidal acts, an appointment for counseling.) Provide the agency with background information (name, address and phone; age and sex; nature of current problem or crisis; any past history you are aware of.) Ask the agency what follow-up action they will take. Find out when they will act on the referral, whom you may contact later, cost of the service, etc. Make sure the person or family and the referral agency connect. Make one or more follow-up contacts with the agency if necessary. Additional resources: Your county family living agent; Farmers Assistance Hotline (for Wisconsin farm families), (800) 942-2474; health and human service workers; clergy; school personnel; financial and legal assistance agencies; UW Extension video “Managing During Tough Times,” (VB0052) Related publications: UW-Extension publications– “Managing Between Jobs—Controlling Stress,” (B3459-11); “Managing Farm Stress,” (B2744-1). Helpless and hopeless. Sense of complete powerlessness, a hopeless feeling. Alcohol or drug abuse. There is often a link between alcoholism, drugs and suicide. Previous suicide attempts. Cries for help: Making a will, giving possessions away, making statements such as “I\\'m calling it quits.” FARM FAMILIES Even without disasters, recent years have been difficult for farm families. Many are experiencing financial and emotional stress that is only heightened by disasters such as flood or tornadoes. There are several signs when a farm family may be in need of help. They include: Changes in routine. The farmer or farm family stops attending church or drops out of community groups. Increase in illness. Farmers or family members may experience more colds, flu, aches and pains. Appearance of farmstead declines. The farm family no longer takes pride in the way farm buildings and grounds appear. Care of livestock declines. Cattle may not be cared for in the usual way; they may lose condition, or show signs of abuse. Increase in farm accidents. The risk of farm accidents increases because of fatigue or loss of ability to concentrate. Children show signs of stress. Farm children may act out, experience academic declines or increased school absences; they also may show signs of physical abuse or neglect. HOW TO REFER A PERSON FOR HELP If you see signs that the person or family needs help that you can\\'t provide (financial, legal or personal counseling), try to assess what agency or community resource would be most appropriate. Then discuss the referral with the person or family. You might say, “It sounds/looks like you are feeling____. I think ____ could help you deal with your situation.” Explore the individual or family\\'s willingness to initiate contact with the community resource. Ask, “How do you feel about seeking help from this person/agency?” If they are unwilling to take the initiative or there is some danger if action is not taken, you should call an agency for assistance. (See sidebar, above left.) Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension; Health and Human Issues Department, UW-Madison/Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Helping Your Child Cope With Disaster WAYS TO HELP CHILDREN DEAL WITH STRESS Emotional support of children is very important during a disaster. If not addressed, a child\\'s fears may continue long after the actual disaster has passed. Young children are particularly at risk during these times because of their deep sense of vulnerability, their lack of understanding and their difficulty in communicating how they feel. Older children are affected too. Like their younger siblings, they might find it difficult to express their feelings. They may be terribly frightened of how the disaster might affect their future. Fortunately, parents and other adults can make a great difference in how children deal with stress. Your love and support can carry children over the rough spots. Initially, it helps to recognize some normal reactions that children may have to disaster. From there, you can take practical steps to foster understanding and support. FEARS It is normal for children to be afraid, especially with the uncertainty brought by natural disasters like a flood or tornado. The fear may last for an extended period of time and is best dealt with by kindness and understanding on the part of parents. Children should be encouraged to talk about their feelings and express their fears through play, drawing, painting or working with clay. Children\\'s fears vary according to age, maturity and previous learning experience. Four major fears common in children are: death, darkness, animals and abandonment. If they have experienced flooding, fire or tornado, children may have encountered several of these fears. Fears may be intensified when adults back away from discussing the topic with children. Many families ban all painful topics from family conversation. A better approach is to openly talk with your children about their feelings. WHAT YOU CAN DO Talk with your child, providing simple, accurate information to questions. This helps avoid the fear of the unknown. Listen to what your child says and how your child says it. Is there fear, anxiety, insecurity? Repeating the child\\'s words may be very helpful, such as “You are afraid that...” or “You wonder if the flood will come again tonight?” This helps both you and the child clarify feelings. Make sure children know the family\\'s difficulties are not their fault. Children tend to blame themselves for problems. Reassure your child with statements such as “We are together. We care about you. We will take care of you.” You may need to repeat information and reassurances many times. Hold your child. Provide comfort. Touching is important for children during this period. Close contact helps assure children that you are there for them and will not abandon them. Involve children. Let them help fill a sandbag or participate in a safe, simple clean-up activity. This helps them feel they are part of the family. It also helps them feel needed, appreciated and useful. Spend extra time putting your child to bed. Talk and offer assurance. Leave a night light on if that makes the child feel more secure.

Observe your child at play. Listen to what is said and watch how the child plays. Children frequently express feelings of fear or anger while playing with dolls, trucks or friends after a major disaster. Provide play experiences to relieve tension. Work with clay and paint; play in water, etc. If children show a need to hit or kick, give them something safe like a pillow, ball or balloon. Allow a safe, open space for them to play if possible. If your child lost a meaningful toy or blanket, allow the child to mourn and grieve (by crying, perhaps). In time, it may be helpful to replace the lost object. Contact a community resource such as your doctor, mental health agency or minister if you sense you need outside help for a child. Keep your sense of humor and enjoy a good laugh together frequently. Take care of your own emotions and stress. Children will reflect your anxiety or your calm. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Kansas State University Cooperative Extension Service, University of Illinois Cooperative Extension Service, North Carolina Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Hiring a Contractor After a Disaster LOCATING QUALIFIED PEOPLE AND AVOIDING FRAUD If your home has been damaged by a natural disaster, you are probably eager to have repairs made. But it is well worth your time to find a reliable contractor for the job. Most people start by asking friends, neighbors and colleagues for recommendations. Hardware stores, lumberyards, insurance agents and lending institutions may be able to recommend contractors as well. If your community is receiving disaster assistance, check with agency personnel for lists of contractors. Always get a written contract for repairs, but don\\'t be pressured to hurriedly sign it. Ask for references and check them out. If sub-contractors will be used, do the same. GENERAL CONTRACTOR OR SPECIALIST? If you need a variety of repairs, you may want to hire a general, building or remodeling contractor to coordinate the project. You sign one contract and the contractor arranges all the work, subcontracting with various specialists — like plumbers, masons or electricians. Specialists often are available to work on a single type of repair such as: concrete, masonry, carpentry, drywall, insulation, painting, floor coverings, electrical work, plumbing, heating, roofing, siding, waterproofing, and fire and flood restoration. DO YOUR HOMEWORK When it comes to home repair, it\\'s important to understand the options you have, as well as some of the terms contractors use. Some good sources of information include your county Extension office, disaster assistance center, lumberyard or local librarian. Also think about any home improvements that might be combined with repairs, such as modifications to increase energy efficiency or sump pump installation to prevent future basement flooding. INTERVIEWING CONTRACTORS Be prepared to have contractors approach you after a disaster. Make sure they are legitimate business persons. Are they registered with county authorities? Do they have a business card, brochure, letterhead and telephone number? Ask if they belong to any trade associations. For plumbers and electricians, ask to see their state license. Write down a list of questions you want to ask each prospective contractor and interview at least three. Some possible questions include: Does the contractor have a good reputation? Ask for references from previous jobs and if you can see examples of past work. Ask where he or she plans to purchase materials and contact the supplier to see if bills are paid on time. Call the local building inspector, Better Business Bureau, Home Builders Association, Building Trade Council or chamber of commerce to see if any complaints have been filed against the contractor. Does the contractor have appropriate insurance? Contractors should have liability insurance and workers\\' compensation insurance. If not, you may be liable for accidents on your property. Ask the contractor for proof of current insurance coverage. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension COMMUNITY/FAMILY ISSUES-REBUILDING more information CONTRACT PROBLEMS? If problems arise with a contract: 1) Try to resolve them directly with the contractor. Do this in writing so you both have a copy; 2) If you cannot resolve the problems, contact the Consumer Protection Office for Wisconsin at (800) 422-7128 or the Better Business Bureau at (800) 273-1002; 3) Contact the contractor\\'s trade association. They may act as an intermediary or arrange arbitration. Additional resources: Your county family living agent Related publications: UW-Extension publication “Hiring a Contractor After a Natural Disaster,” December 1993. “Home Improvement and Repairs,” Office of Consumer Protection, Wisconsin Department of Justice, June 1982. Will the contractor provide a written estimate? You should insist on a written estimate. The estimate usually will be in the form of a contract you can sign to hire the contractor. When comparing estimates, be sure that all bids are based on the same work. And if you plan to do some of the restoration work yourself, be sure to check with the contractor to see how this will affect warranties and the schedule. Remember, the lowest bid is not always the best one. There may be a misunderstanding of the nature of the work being quoted, a mistake in the quote, poor quality workmanship being offered or use of low-grade materials. QUESTIONS TO ASK REFERENCES Call at least two contractor references. Here are a few questions to ask: Why did you decide to use this contractor? What work was done for you? Was it completed on time? Are you happy with the finished product? Did the workers keep the project area neat and clean? Was the work completed at the price stated in the contract? Would you hire this contractor again? CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS Get a written contract. Oral contracts can\\'t always be enforced. Include the building plans and/or specifications in the contract. Specify the start and finish dates to protect your interests, but realize that bad weather, unavailable materials or other problems may affect these dates. Include pay schedules for the work and itemized prices for the work. If you want special materials — for example, hardwood trim or top grade lumber — be sure this is specified. If possible, have a lawyer review all contracts and related documents before you sign. Don\\'t make a large first payment, and don\\'t pay for the project in full until work has been completed and inspected. Clearly state any warranties or guarantees on the work. Be sure both you and the contractor sign the agreement, with each of you keeping original copies. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, University of Florida Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Site Selection When Building HOW TO AVOID GROUNDWATER FLOODING Groundwater flooding in homes is a common seasonal nuisance. Floors and walls may get wet, resulting in minor damages. In heavy rainfall years, high groundwater can become a much more serious and widespread concern as more homes are affected and the damage is greater. The best time to think about groundwater flooding is before land is purchased or a home is built. Any site should be examined carefully to determine the potential for groundwater problems. If you have already selected a site with potential groundwater problems, you can ward off trouble with various construction modifications. ASSESSING THE LAND Get input from experts in the area of soils and groundwater when evaluating property for possible construction. Some good resources include county planning and zoning offices, the Soil Conservation Service, contractors with groundwater expertise, well drilling companies and UW-Extension offices. A number of natural features of the land can be examined to determine whether the site is suitable for building: Topography. The land surface on and around the proposed building site can offer evidence of potential for groundwater flooding. a) Flat landscapes often have shallow depths to water tables, particularly in floodplains of rivers, streams or areas with numerous wetland features. When these areas are subject to extended surface water flooding, they also may experience flooding from rising groundwater. b) Hilly terrains do not guarantee freedom from groundwater problems. Depending on the nature of the bedrock underlying the soils and the characteristics of the soils, groundwater can be close to the surface on some slope locations. Seeps may form on slopes or near the base of slopes as the water table contacts the surface. Vegetation on or near a prospective building site can offer significant clues about the prevailing conditions of soil moisture and potential for groundwater problems. Some native trees such as black willow, black ash, silver maple, red maple, cottonwood, swamp white oak, white cedar and balsam fir are very tolerant of wet soils. Even if the property is not considered a wetland, the presence of pockets of wetland plants such as dogwood, viburnum or alder shrubs, and herbaceous species such as cattails, reed canary grass or bulrushes near the elevation of the building site may indicate high groundwater. Soil characteristics offer an opportunity to confirm suspected groundwater problems. Digging a soil pit to look at the soil profile can reveal evidence of maximum groundwater levels that may be well above the average position of the water table. Since basement excavations are typically in the 5- to 6-foot range, soil pits may not be practical without special equipment or the use of a contractor. Or, you might seek help from a soils expert.

NEW CONSTRUCTION CONSIDERATIONS Perhaps you have already made a decision to build on a site with potential groundwater problems. Or perhaps potential problems became apparent after excavating began. Groundwater trouble still could be avoided by using several construction modifications. House construction can be modified or designed to reduce the risk of groundwater flooding on a site. a) One option is to reduce the depth of the excavation for location of footings. Fill is then added to the landscape to elevate the basement (or slab floor) above the anticipated maximum water table or groundwater level. b) Your contractor may recommend additional drain tile against the footings and basement walls. Drain tile may also be placed under the basement floor; the tile will facilitate drainage down a slope or accommodate a sump pump to relieve water pressure. c) The house design may be altered to minimize the need for full basement construction. This alternative requires less backfill to be hauled in to elevate the house. One design option, for example, is to use a bilevel or split level design, which does not require a fully excavated basement. The septic system can be located and designed to reduce the chance of premature contact of septic waters with groundwater. While testing of soils and percolation rates is required to obtain septic system permits, testing does not guarantee that a site will be free of groundwater flooding. The construction of mound systems in areas known or suspected of potential groundwater problems can be an option or requirement. Well location should take into account the probable direction of groundwater flow. This reduces the risk of having the well positioned “downstream” from the septic system or neighboring septic systems in the event of contact between septic drain fields and groundwater. Well casings can be positioned to reduce the risk of contaminated groundwater or ponded surface waters entering the well. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Erosion Control When Building or Rebuilding CONTROL PRACTICES FOR HOME SITES If you are building or rebuilding following a disaster, make sure you and your builder are in compliance with local, county and state erosion control ordinances. Erosion control is important because eroding construction sites are a leading cause of water quality problems in Wisconsin. Unless a builder uses erosion controls, about a dump truck and a half of soil washes into a nearby lake or stream for every acre under construction. The sediment problems eventually lead to higher taxes for waterway dredging and clean-up of streets, sewers and ditches; lowered property values for areas with sediment-damaged lakes or streams; poor fishing from muddy waterways; and nuisance growth of weeds and algae. Except for new one- and two-family dwellings, local ordinances may be more strict than those from the Wisconsin Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations (DILHR). They may also require erosion control on construction projects not affected by state or federal regulations. EROSION CONTROL PLANS The DILHR Uniform Dwelling Code is enforced for one- and two- family dwellings in most communities. The code requires that an erosion control plan be submitted with the building permit application to the local building inspector. The erosion control plan must show: Location of the dwelling, other buildings, wells, surface waters and disposal systems on the site with respect to property lines. Direction of all slopes on the site. Location and type of erosion control measures. CONTROLS REQUIRED Erosion control is important even for home sites of an acre or less. The materials needed are easy to find and relatively inexpensive — straw bales or silt fence, stakes, stone, plastic tubes and grass seed. Additional controls may be needed for sites that have steep slopes, are adjacent to lakes and streams, receive a lot of runoff from adjacent land, or are larger than an acre. Only a few controls are needed on most sites: Preserving existing trees and grass where possible to prevent erosion. Silt fence or straw bales to trap sediment on the downslope sides of the lot. Stone drive used by all vehicles to limit tracking of mud onto streets. Clean-up of sediment carried off-site by vehicles or storms. Downspout extenders to prevent erosion from roof runoff. Revegetating the site as soon as possible. MAINTENANCE AND WASTE DISPOSAL Sediment controls must be maintained until the site is stabilized by mulching and seeding, sodding or landscaping. All building waste must be properly disposed to prevent pollutants and debris from being carried off-site. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension COMMUNITY/FAMILY ISSUES-REBUILDING more information Additional resources: Your local building inspector or erosion control office, the Wisconsin Depart-ment of Industry, Labor & Human Relations, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, your county Extension office. Related publications: UW-Extension publications– “Erosion Control for Home Builders,” (GWQ001); “Standard Erosion Control Plan for 1 & 2 Family Dwelling Construction Sites,” (GWQ001A). ENFORCEMENT Erosion control inspections will be made during other regular inspections (footing and foundation, rough construction, final, etc.) Violations must be corrected within 72 hours. Stop work orders may be issued for noncompliance. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and Department of Industry, Labor & Human Relations University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Disaster Response PRIORITIES AND RESOURCES FOR COMMUNITIES Communities can either come together or unravel after a disaster. The difference is often the degree of focus, coordina-tion and communication among residents and leaders. It helps if communities identify priorities for emergency response before a disaster occurs. Local government should be familiar with emergency resources within the community and what is available on local, state and national levels. CONCERNS FOLLOWING IMPACT Usually the most critical concerns following disaster impact include: Rescue of injured or endangered residents, removal of victims, evacuation Downed electric wires, power outages Leaking gas mains, ruptured chemical containers Containing and extinguishing fires Prevention of looting RESPONSE RESOURCES Beyond local government and emergency services such as police and fire departments, communities can look for assistance from the following resources: Local emergency government. Every county in Wisconsin is required by state statute to have an emergency government office and director in place. While larger cities may have local directors, smaller communities often have a critical need for the leadership and direction county emergency government can offer. The American Red Cross. Providing food and shelter to disaster survivors is a major thrust of Red Cross assistance, but assistance can also extend to back-up medical services, especially in smaller communities. The state highway department may be called in for rerouting of traffic and related concerns. The National Guard may be called in to prevent looting, help with sandbagging in a flood or any number of other measures involving manpower. Declarations from the president. Once a preliminary damage assessment has been completed by emergency response personnel, the state governor can request a major disaster or emergency declaration from the President of the United States: a) Declaration of an Emergency - The president can issue this declaration to supplement state and local effort to save lives and protect property. Total assistance provided may not exceed $5 million. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension COMMUNITY/FAMILY ISSUES-COMMUNITY RECOVERY more information Additional resources: Your local emergency government office, your local Extension agents, the American Red Cross, the Federal Emergency Management Agency b) Declaration of a Major Disaster - After a natural catastrophe, assistance is offered to both public and private sectors through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Nearly 100 different programs and services help provide disaster relief. OTHER RESPONSE CONCERNS Once rescue concerns and other immediate dangers are taken care of, another level of activity needs to take place. Sometimes these concerns must be addressed upon impact. Is the water safe to drink? Testing for safe water should begin and continue throughout disaster recovery because of the chance of contamination from many different sources. Sewers. Chemical spillage needs immediate attention to prevent problems at the sewage treatment plant. In some cases the plant may be overloaded because of floodwaters. Structural safety. Are buildings and homes safe to enter? Professional building inspection is critical. Hazardous materials. All hazardous materials stored at commercial and other properties should be accounted for, from industrial chemicals to those used at drycleaners and gas stations. Spills can be a problem, and pressurized tanks could burst. Fire departments are required to keep an inventory of hazardous material locations. Damaged trees, debris. Debris is a major cause of injury during clean-up. Machinery should be brought in to help clear and dispose of wreckage. Some communities have brought in metal removers after a tornado to adequately clear farm fields for safe tractor use. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Texas A&M University University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Getting Local Government Back on Track MEETING OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES AFTER A DISASTER When disaster strikes a community, government leaders are under intense pressure to stay on top of recovery issues. Residents, business, government units and the media want answers and direction, even if emergency government has taken the reigns on emergency response efforts. If local leaders are among those affected by the disaster, getting government back on track can be especially difficult. But use of all available expertise and resources can ease the situation. GENERAL GUIDELINES Recognize there is often a delicate balance between emergency government and local government. While emergency government has statutory authority for response efforts after a disaster, disagreements and resentments can occur unless there is cooperation, trust and ongoing communication between local and emergency officials. This is also true during the recovery phase, when the community has ultimate authority, but other agencies are still involved. Discuss your community\\'s recovery needs with state and U.S. representatives. They can be a great asset in obtaining disaster assistance on the state and national levels. Recognize that you may be competing with other communities across the nation for assistance. Take advantage of all available expertise and resources. Your community will need help on a continuing basis for a long time after a disaster. Cooperative Extension specialists in the area of community resources can often help local leaders see the “big picture,” find their way through the government maze, and utilize every available resource. These resources may include: a) local emergency government b) Cooperative Extension agents, including county agents and specialists from throughout the state c) state agencies, such as the Department of Natural Resources, the Department of Development and Department of Transportation d) the National Guard e) the Federal Emergency Management Agency f) the American Red Cross, the Salvation Army, churches and volunteer groups g) regional planning commissions h) temporary employees. Limited-term employees can be of great help to communities in the months following a disaster. Funding is often available through state or federal disaster relief agencies. Balance the pressure to speed recovery with the need for planning and new growth within a community. Getting local government back on track may mean new efforts to: a) Provide business counseling to local merchants that have sustained damage. The rebuilding period is an excellent time to re-evaluate business and make necessary improvements or changes in focus. Economic recovery can go hand in hand with disaster recovery. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension COMMUNITY/FAMILY ISSUES-COMMUNITY RECOVERY more information Additional resources: Your local emergency government office, your county community resource and development agent, the American Red Cross, the Federal Emergency Management Agency b) Consider land-use and zoning changes that are long overdue. c) Address aesthetic issues as business and residents begin rebuilding. These may cover architectural styles, colors, textures, size and height restrictions, and signage. Don\\'t ignore your own needs. It\\'s critical to keep a balance between your public duty and your personal life — especially if your home and family have been affected by disaster. It\\'s not uncommon for leaders to spend all their time coordinating disaster efforts only to resign shortly afterward because they neglected their own concerns. WORKING WITH THE PUBLIC Community meetings can be an excellent way to get everyone moving in the same direction. However, it\\'s better to hold meetings after the emergency response phase has passed and the community is out of danger. That way people can more calmly focus on recovery, clean-up efforts and their future. During the emergency phase, people need basic information about shelter, medical assistance, food and disaster relief. Radio and television announcements and relief workers can usually do the job most efficiently. Drop-in centers for information on disaster relief are another good idea. Communities can use a municipal building, school, library or other public building to dispense information on everything from temporary housing and disaster loans to water-damaged basements. Relief agency representa-tives can be available to residents daily or weekly. Local officials should also be available on a regular basis to meet with residents. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Planning and Zoning After a Disaster IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE LONG-TERM Following a disaster, residents and business owners will be anxious to rebuild and in some cases relocate. This is a critical time for local government to assess issues of land use in terms of safety and long-term development concerns. Smaller communities may not have land-use plans or zoning ordinances. Training and assistance is often needed to begin using these tools after a disaster. Larger communities usually have land-use plans and zoning ordinances, but they may need to be updated to reflect changing circumstances. And communities of all sizes may need assistance in handling the sudden surge in zoning permits and land-use proposals. Additional resources: Your local emergency government office, your county community resource and development agent, the American Red Cross, the Federal Emergency Management Agency IMMEDIATE CONCERNS While local government needs to act quickly on issues of planning and zoning after a disaster, the long-term impact of each decision must be taken into account. This is an important principle to remember and discuss at public meetings when emotions are running high. Land-use plans and zoning ordinances are especially useful if there has been a great deal of destruction. They can provide the community with a blueprint for the future. Regional planning commissions or county zoning departments often can help train local officials in setting up land-use and zoning review boards. If a land-use plan exists, check to see that it is up to date. Check building codes, subdivision ordinances and ordinances on land-use and building. Communities with an office of planning or zoning may need to hire temporary staffing to help with an increased number of requests. CONCERNS DURING THE REVIEW PROCESS Look for existing land-use conflicts. Examples might include machine shops within neighborhoods, bars next to churches or schools, and dangerous chemical suppliers or high-truck traffic in a downtown. Be wary of proposals that cause new land-use conflicts. Recognize there is a tendency to restore things immediately to the “way they were” without an eye to what makes sound, attractive community development. Special considerations need to be taken for properties located in flood zones. Communities may need to rezone areas, buy properties or use condemnation procedures. Sometimes rezoning a property to a “non-conforming use” can be helpful. This usually prohibits additions to property or repairs that are more than half the assessment value of homes. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension COMMUNITY/FAMILY ISSUES-COMMUNITY RECOVERY Aesthetics and Design Ordinances HELPING GUIDE THE LOOK OF THINGS TO COME A community will never look quite the same after a major disaster. Beautiful old trees may be lost forever. Some neighborhoods get facelifts, others may drift apart. Storefronts and cityscapes change. People are anxious to restore things to order, even if it\\'s not possible to turn back the clock. The trouble is, hasty recovery efforts can leave a community with a hodgepodge appearance that no one ever intended. Worse yet, communities that weren\\'t well-planned in the first place are sometimes all too successful in recreating the old look. Design ordinances with a concern for appearance can make the difference. With them, you can help ensure that new and renovated structures are compatible with existing architecture. The purpose is not to lay down a long list of restrictions, but to help avoid potential eyesores or structures not in keeping with the character of an area. Typical concerns covered by ordinances include architectural style, texture and color, size and height, and signage. GETTING SET UP Try to set up a design review committee, if you don\\'t already have one, early on in the recovery phase. From there you can discuss aesthetics concerns and how they can be reflected in design ordinances. Committee training is important. You need smooth operations and review procedures to inspire confidence from fellow citizens. Help and expertise can come from your Extension community development agents, county planning agencies, private consultants and your regional plan commission. Committee members may be appointed from local representatives of government, but it\\'s often a good idea to appoint citizen members as well. Begin with the notion that what\\'s being built today in your community will last 70, 80 or 100 years. With that in mind, aesthetics become a weighty issue. This is a good time to discuss an existing or potential community theme. Try to build up and/or reflect community pride in your discussions and actions. Is the community known for its historical architecture, natural beauty, waterways, ethnic heritage, recreation, manufacturing history, or small town feel? What\\'s important to the look or the character of place? Guard against a sterile look. It\\'s easy to forget that the charm of older homes and buildings is often their multiple textures — the brick, wood, glass and surrounding trees and vegetation. Metal pole-frame buildings, new siding and strip malls may go up fast, but they won\\'t generate the same warmth or interest. If historic preservation is a concern, get assistance from groups like the Wisconsin Trust for Historic Preservation and the State Historical Society. Remember that historic preservation extends to rural structures, including historically significant barns and outbuildings. MAKING A CASE FOR AESTHETICS Educating the public about aesthetic concerns is a major part of the committee\\'s work. When people hear the words “design ordinances,” they may have fears about radical changes in the wind. Expect resistance through the review process. Meet it by listening to fears and concerns, and negotiating win-win solutions whenever possible. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension COMMUNITY/FAMILY ISSUES-COMMUNITY RECOVERY more information Additional resources: Your local emergency government office, your county community resource and development agent, the American Red Cross, the Federal Emergency Management Agency Related publications: UW-Extension publication “Community Growth Policy — Economic Impacts of Growth and Local Policy Choices,” (NCR079). Try to use drawings, models and slides of what the community (or area of reconstruction) can look like. Consultants regularly provide these, but sometimes government planning agencies can assist as well. Realize that people take for granted that aesthetics will be the same when the community has recovered. Discourage incompatible mixes of architecture or building uses. At the same time, help businesses think about aesthetics and their image in the community. If businesses need to remodel or relocate, help them in their efforts; make them part of the big picture. Realize that you can\\'t be too strict or people will have trouble with ordinances. Rejecting gaudy paint colors is one thing; specifying a palette of permissible colors may be a bit extreme for many communities. Be aware of typical aesthetic problems following a disaster: a) Temporary structures such as pole-frame barns or trailers can become permanent structures if communities aren\\'t vigilant. b) Some people, including those on design review committees, rally around themes that may not be appropriate for a community. Choosing an ethnic or other unifying theme is a major decision that needs support from the community to be a success. What has worked in one community may not work for another. If the disaster was a major historical event for your community, consider ways of commemorating the disaster and those touched by it. You might incorporate a public display, memorial or cornerstone into a public building, park or other space. Such symbolic structures can be very powerful to a community\\'s identity and emotional recovery. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Economic Development When Rebuilding FOSTERING GROWTH AFTER A DISASTER Communities should take a good look at economic development goals after a disaster. For various reasons, the time is ripe for planning. Building and relocation activity may be occurring at an unprecedented rate during recovery efforts. Business and private individuals may have available cash from property and insurance checks. Industry and businesses that were only marginally profitable before the disaster face major decisions about staying in business, relocating or changing direction. To guide positive economic growth, communities should have economic development plans in place. Now is the time to review plans and update them as necessary. Small communities without such plans can get assistance from county development corporations or regional planning commissions. In addition to planning for private growth, communities need to be farsighted about public property replacement and improvements. WHERE DO WE WANT TO BE? Economic development is a process guided by both planning and unforeseen events, such as business closures, new industry or disasters. Communities need to assess current economic development conditions when disaster strikes. But they also need to ask, “Where do we want to be five, 10 and 25 years from now?” And “How do our decisions and assistance today affect the outcome?” Here are two guidelines to keep in mind: Reassess economic conditions and existing development plans. Discuss the history and direction of your community as you review public policy related to economic development. Re-evaluate economic development plans currently on the books — they may not reflect current goals or changed circumstances because of destruction. If your community has no economic development plan in place, get assistance. Don\\'t work in a vacuum. Contact your local Extension office, your county development corporation or regional planning commission. All can offer expertise on retaining, expanding and attracting business and industry to your community. REBUILDING GUIDELINES Make sure you are not rebuilding mistakes. Examine areas affected by disaster and consider how they fit into current economic development goals. Some industries may need to relocate to new or existing industrial parks. Likewise, some businesses may be better suited to business parks or other areas. Consider existing and potential traffic patterns. In some cases, roads may need to be rebuilt to suit changing needs. Help local business and industry take advantage of disaster relief sources. These may include private insurance, low-interest loan programs, grants and business counseling. a) Small business that was struggling to stay afloat before the disaster often can benefit from Small Business Development Center assistance. Business plans can be reviewed for viability and new plans established. Because businesses may have insurance checks in hand, this is an excellent time to consider improvements in retail space, location, production facilities and marketing.

The support of local government may be needed to streamline recovery efforts, including approval processes, and provision of utilities, transportation and communication. Encourage timely rebuilding where feasible. Remember that your community may lose tax revenue from structures that are not rebuilt within the year. Keep disaster preparedness and mitigation in mind as rebuilding begins. Some structures may need to be flood-proofed, raised or relocated. Tornado shelters and expanded warning systems are typical improvements after tornadoes. Fire prevention should be a concern as any structures are rebuilt. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Caring for Flooded Lawns DAMAGE ASSESSMENT AND RESTORATION Lawns usually survive being underwater for up to four days. But you may have to replace the lawn if floodwaters caused erosion or brought chemicals, contaminants or more than an inch of mud or silt. Your major concern this growing season should be stabilizing the soil to prevent further sediment movement. Planting a temporary lawn is usually the best way to do this. Next year you can establish permanent grasses. While floodwater may cause new weed problems, keep in mind that some weed cover is better than no cover. Weeds help dry out soil. WHEN THE LAWN IS UNDERWATER Damage to your lawn will depend on many factors including duration of submergence, water depth, temperature, grass species, light intensity and condition of the grass prior to flooding. A few general rules: Grasses survive much longer at water temperatures below 60 degrees F. than at higher temperatures. But most grasses survive submergence at normal summer temperatures. Tolerance to submergence varies among grasses in the Midwest. Bentgrass has excellent tolerance, while Kentucky bluegrass, tall fescue and rough bluegrass have intermediate tolerance. Fineleaf fescue and perennial ryegrass generally have poor tolerance. As soon as possible after the water recedes, aerate the soil to a depth of at least three inches and lightly fertilize flooded areas. You can rent a mechanical aerator from your lawn and garden store or use a pitchfork. Areas submerged longer than four to six days may not survive and will require complete re-establishment (see steps in section on heavy silt deposits below). DEALING WITH AN INCH OF SILT Lawns submerged for less than four days and covered with an inch of silt or less have a good chance of recovery. To assist recovery: Wash as much silt as possible from the lawn using a garden hose. Use a steel tooth garden rake, a mechanical aerator or spiking equipment to break up the silt crust. Keep it broken throughout the growing season or until grass has become well established. Collect a representative soil sample and have it tested by your county Extension office for nitrogen, lime, phosphorous and potassium requirements. Agents can make recommendations on fertilizer and nutrients. If lawn recovery is spotty or generally thin, mechanically aerate the lawn four to six times in late summer or early spring. Then overseed with a desirable permanent seed mixture. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension COMMUNITY/FAMILY ISSUES-TREE/LAWN RECOVERY more information HANDLING EROSION If your lawn\\'s topsoil has been greatly eroded, replace it to a depth of 4 to 6 inches late in the growing season. If topsoil is unavailable or too expensive, you can improve existing soil by adding organic matter such as peat, rotted sawdust, manure or other materials. Apply these materials at a rate of 3 cubic yards per 1,000 square feet of lawn area and work them into the top 4 inches of subsoil. A temporary lawn, established immediately and later worked into the subsoil, can also be a source of organic matter. Additional resources: Your county agricultural agent, your local emergency government office, the American Red Cross, the Federal Emergency Management Agency Related publications: UW-Extension publications– “Lawn Maintenance and Problems,” (A3435); “Lawn Establishment,” (A3434); “Sampling Lawn and Garden Soils for Soil Testing,” (A2166). DEALING WITH HEAVY SILT DEPOSITS Lawns covered with more than an inch of silt may be heavily damaged, with only a slight chance of recovery. The degree of recovery will vary with grass species and depth of silt. Re-establish the lawn as follows: If silt accumulation exceeds 3 inches, consider having silt removed professionally. However, it may be more practical to rototill the area, using the silt layer as a new topsoil and having it tested for nutrients. If silt is less than 3 inches, or has been removed to this depth, till the area, making sure the silt is mixed thoroughly and uniformly through the top 4 inches of the original soil. Take a soil sample of the new soil mixture after silt has been mixed in. Have the mixture tested to determine lime, phosphate and potash requirements. Retill after applying lime and fertilizer according to soil test recommendations. Reseed the area as you would to establish a new lawn. Seedings, especially of cool season grasses, should be made in early spring or late summer. ESTABLISHING TEMPORARY LAWNS Where lawns must be completely re-established and immediate cover is needed, scratch the soil surface with a hand rake or similar tillage tool. Seed annual ryegrass at a rate of 4 to 6 pounds per 1,000 square feet. Till the ryegrass under at the appropriate time for re-establishment. Seed permanent grasses. OIL AND CHEMICAL SPILLS Soils may have been saturated with oil, herbicides or other toxic material. Petroleum will eventually decompose, but nothing can be done in the meantime to cancel its harmful effects. On large areas, bury oil deposits by deep plowing. On small areas, remove petroleum-soaked soil to a depth of 6 inches, and replace with new topsoil. Have a soil test taken; lime can often be added as a neutralizer. Reseed at the appropriate time. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Pennsylvania State University Cooperative Extension Service University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Solid Waste and Contamination Concerns GUIDELINES FOR COMMUNITIES AFTER A DISASTER Solid waste management is critical to communities after a disaster. While the tendency is to clear major areas of debris first, identification and control of hazardous materials should take priority. Without these efforts, human life and the environment may be threatened. Potential hazards include contamination of public and private water supplies, fire, explosions, toxic releases into the atmosphere, chemical contamination of properties and waterways, and direct exposure to unsuspecting residents or emergency response teams. HAZARDOUS DEBRIS Notify local emergency government officials. Depending upon the hazard potential of released materials, teams of trained hazardous materials specialists may be called on site immediately. Control and containment of hazardous materials will be the first priority. Appropriate state and federal authorities should be notified as well. Identify areas of hazardous materials and potential contamination. Facility site plans are good sources of public information for any public, agricultural or commercial facilities that house significant quantities of hazardous substances. Required by the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, these plans are filed on-site and with the local fire department, Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and State Emergency Response Board (SERB). Plans identify community hazards ranging from underground fuel tanks and pesticide storage areas to toxic cleaning solvents, manufacturing wastes and explosives. Evacuate any areas where hazardous materials may cause harm. If necessary, rope off areas to keep people out and place warning signs signifying the danger. Contact appropriate state agencies, such as the Department of Natural Resources and Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection. They offer technical guidance on clean-up regulations and options for managing hazardous materials. Options may include landfilling, incineration or chemical treatment. Segregate hazardous from nonhazardous substances in all levels of clean-up. Stress the importance of segregating materials to residents involved in home clean-up activities, as well as recovering businesses, manufacturers and farmers. Consult state officials to determine local hazardous material collection options. NONHAZARDOUS DEBRIS County landfills and other licensed solid waste disposal facilities are the logical sites for nonhazardous solid waste after a disaster. However, in some cases, special one-time disposal sites may be available for commu-nities or individuals. This was the case for the community of Barneveld, Wisconsin, following the 1984 tornado that caused major destruction. A one-time disposal facility was established in a local quarry. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension COMMUNITY/FAMILY ISSUES-WATER/SANITATION more information Additional resources Your county emergency government office, the Department of Natural Resources, the Wisconsin Division of Emergency Government, your county Extension office One-time disposal facilities must be approved by the State of Wisconsin, in accordance with Wisconsin Administrative Code regulation NR 502.12. State inspection, reporting and operational requirements must be met, including a design capacity not to exceed 10,000 cubic yards. Restrictions include a maximum site life of six months, well monitoring, and provisions for closure and ongoing inspection. Procedures for nonhazardous debris collection after a disaster differ for residential, commercial and rural areas. Consult with regulatory officials regarding collection requirements and disposal options. Be sure you obtain necessary regulatory approvals before taking action. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension Water Contamination in Private Wells REPAIR, CLEAN-UP AND DISINFECTION Wells that have been overtopped by floodwater pose a number of immediate dangers, from electrical shock to serious water-borne illnesses. Therefore, do not turn on your pump after flooding has occurred and do not drink or wash with well water. Your well and pump need to be inspected after a flood. Your well also needs to be properly disinfected and its water tested for safety. WELL AND PUMP INSPECTION Swiftly moving floodwater can carry large debris that could loosen well hardware, dislodge well construction materials or distort casing. Coarse sediment in the floodwaters could erode pump components. In some cases, floods may cause some wells to collapse. For all these reasons, you should have professionals inspect your system. Electrical system. Do not turn on the equipment until the wiring system has been checked by a qualified electrician, well contractor or pump contractor. If the pump\\'s control box was submerged during the flood, all electrical components must be cleaned and dry before electrical service can be restored. Get assistance in turning the pump on from the well or pump contractor. Pump operation. All pumps and their electrical components may be damaged by sediment and floodwater. The pump, including the valves and gears, needs to be cleaned of silt and sand. If pumps are not properly cleaned and lubricated they can burn out. Get assistance from a well or pump contractor who can clean, repair and maintain different types of pumps. General cleaning of drilled, driven or bored wells. To avoid damage to the well, have the contractor remove mud, silt and other debris from around the well top. If excessive mud, silt or sediment has entered the well, the pump may need to be removed before cleaning can take place. Dug wells. Do not attempt to disinfect or use a dug well that has been flooded. PUMPING THE WELL After the contractor services and cleans the well, pump it until the water runs clear to rid the well of floodwater. Depending on the size and depth of the well and extent of contamination, pumping times will vary. If the water does not run clear, get advice from the county or state health department or Extension service. EMERGENCY DISINFECTION After flooding, a well must be disinfected to kill bacteria and other potential disease-causing organisms. Wells that are less than 50 feet deep may be contaminated even if there is no apparent flood damage. The following steps apply to drilled, driven or bored wells only. Disinfection should not be attempted for dug wells. University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension COMMUNITY/FAMILY ISSUES-WATER/SANITATION more information Additional resources: Your county Extension office, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the Wisconsin Department of Health and Social Services Related publications: UW-Extension publications– “Drinking Water Contamination: Understanding the Risks,” (G3339); “Maintaining Your Home Well Water System,” (G3399); “Home Water Safety,” (G3558, 1-5). DNR publication, “Bacteriological Contamination of Drinking Water.” Follow the instructions above for pumping the well. Prepare a chlorine solution. Approximately 8 quarts of 5.25-percent (or 5 quarts of 10 percent) chlorine bleach such as Hilex, Clorox, etc., should be mixed with 100 gallons of water. It is best to prepare more solution than the amount of water standing in the well; if this amount is unknown, the 100-gallon measure is a safe estimate. Most garbage cans hold 30 gallons or more; therefore, filling three (clean) cans with the solution is sufficient. Pour or pump the solution in the well in one continuous flow. Attach a hose to a faucet and, making certain the hose itself is clean, place the other end of the hose into the well. Open the faucet and recirculate the chlorinated water for one hour, washing down the inside of the casing and pump piping. Faucets in your house should be opened until you detect a chlorine smell, then close them. Allow the chlorine solution to remain in the well and piping for at least 24 hours, preferably longer. The system should then be purged free of chlorine. Since it can disrupt a septic system, the chlorinated water should be run outdoors, perhaps into a ditch. It may kill grass and shrubs, and should not be run into a lake or stream. SAMPLING AND TESTING Once all flooded wells have been disinfected, wait one week to have the water sampled and tested by a state-certified laboratory or health department. Do not drink the water until two consecutive tests come back safe. If the laboratory issues sterile bottles for sampling, carefully follow all instructions for their use. If the test comes back unsafe, redisinfect. If the test comes back safe, retest in two weeks. Unfortunately, your well may not be a safe source of water for months after extensive flooding or high groundwater. Wastewater from malfunctioning septic tanks or chemical seepage can contaminate the groundwater even after water was tested and found to be safe. You need to take long-range precautions, including repeated testing, to protect the safety of drinking water. Keep in mind that even under normal conditions, all private wells should be tested annually. Information from: University of Wisconsin Cooperative Extension, Environmental Protection Agency, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources University of Wisconsin-Extension Cooperative Extension --- Content from Copy of Getting Started in Solar --- Getting started with solar power By Sue Robishaw and Steve Schmeck www.manytracks.com Revised and updated from original article printed in the May/June 1994, 78/3 issue. We call this \"The Homestead System\" because this is how we, and so many others, started with solar electric. You can do it, too. Get your foot, or your whole self, into this circle called Alternative Energy. But be forewarned! Living ever closer to the Sun and the Wind and the Earth can be addictive. Here is a way to start cutting yourself out of the game of destruction played by oil, gas, coal and nuclear industries. This is your basic photovoltaic system. How much usable electricity you get from this setup will depend on where you are located (both geographically and site specifically) and what Mother Nature is doing with the weather. You need sun to shine on your solar modules in order for that sun energy to be converted into electricity for you to utilize. Get out and look at your site, track the sun\\'s pattern, draw sun charts. Few sites are 100% great. You will probably have to figure, think and compromise, but that is half the fun! There is a nifty device called the Solar Pathfinder that can chart your site for direct sun for every month of the year (SolarPathfinder, 3680 Hwy. 438, Pleasantville, TN 37147, 931-593-3552, pathfinder@mlec.net, www.solarpathfinder.com). It\\'s a great way to find that certain spot with the best solar gain. Check with local alternative energy dealers-many offer a site survey service. Or you can make your own sun chart. See The Passive Solar Energy Book by Edward Mazria, Rodale Press (1979) for detailed instructions. Or just observe your own particular site over a year\\'s time. Generally, the closer to your home (and the batteries) you can place your panels, the better. The farther away you get, the more expensive it\\'s going to be, because you\\'ll need larger wire or more equipment. This article is an overview of a small, simple system. This is not a project you can do from your armchair, you have to get involved. So get as much information as you need to install your system (or help someone else install your system) safely. Talk with dealers and users in your area. Check out Home Power magazine (www.homepower.com, PO Box 520, Ashland, OR 97520). Dealer catalogs/design guides can also be a good source of information. The heart of the system So what might your system include? The heart of the system is the batteries. If you want to know how long someone has been involved in renewable energy (RE) ask them how they started. You are likely to get a variation on the tale of \"Well, I had an old car battery and wired it up to run a few tail light bulbs for lights and a radio. When it ran down I\\'d jury rig it up to my truck and charge it up while I ran into town\"...or, \"I\\'d haul my battery over to a neighbor\\'s house to charge it up.\" And since the battery usually wasn\\'t intended for this type of use, it would soon die and another old battery scrounged up to put into service. We started that way, though we used the 12 volt marine deep cycle battery. They last longer than a regular car battery, but are still not the best, no matter what their name, or advertising, suggests. Some lucky (smart) people start right off with a good home system battery-the golf cart battery. Readily available and recyclable, they are relatively inexpensive. With good care they can last five to eight years, and they can limp along much longer than that when necessary. They are six volt batteries, so you need two (or sets of two) for your 12 volt system. (Ed. note: Regular car batteries are 12 volt, for those who don\\'t know.) One set will give you a 220 amp hour battery bank for about $170. To help the batteries to a good, long life, plan on not using more than 50% of that capacity. So for this system we can plan on 110 amp hours of usable energy from the two golf cart batteries. The best bet for battery housing is a place above freezing temperature and close to where you will be using the electricity. But-batteries can be dangerous. Just because they are common doesn\\'t mean you should thoughtlessly stick them just anywhere. Batteries can explode, though, luckily, this isn\\'t common. So build them their own place. A simple enclosed box can be made, with a vent to the outside (batteries give off small amounts of explosive gases when charging). Also keep in mind that you want easy access to the batteries for checking the water levels and adding distilled water when needed. And keep a good supply of baking soda handy nearby \"just in case.\" The baking soda will neutralize the battery acid in case of a spill. Learn how to take good care of your batteries and they will respond by giving you longer service. The photovoltaic panel Now the showy part-your photovoltaic (PV) panels. They come in many brands and sizes, new and used, big and small. They each have their pluses and minuses but mostly one is as good as another. Today (2004) new panels come with a guarantee of at least 20 years. Used units can also be a good option. But for our purposes here we\\'ll go with one of the common modules sold, a Shell Solar, SQ80. The panel costs about $375 and puts out 80 watts (4.5 amps) of power in full sun. It is interesting that when we bought our first PV module back in 1981, the cost was about the same, but Sue Robishaw and Steve Schmeck\\'s off-grid home in Cooks, Michigan its output was only 32 watts (2.2 amps). PV technology has come a long way. PV rack or mount A solid rack to install your panel(s) on can be purchased, but you can make one yourself fairly easily using readily available materials, either purchased or scrounged. You don\\'t want to skimp here. This rack is holding quite an investment of your money (not to mention your power source). Your rack can be set at one angle or be adjustable, be roof mounted or pole mounted. Your dealer should be able to give you help with a design. A simple control panel Your \"control panel\" for a system such as this can be fairly simple. A Schottky blocking diode between the panel and the batteries will prevent bleeding of your battery power back into the panels (and into the night) when you are not charging. Cost: $10. You should have a disconnect, such as a 25 amp SPST switch ($7), between the panel and battery. Another disconnect should be installed between the battery and all loads, along with an automotive-type in-line 10 amp fuse. You will also want a minimum metering of at least an inexpensive digital multi meter ($50 from Radio Shack). You need to keep track of your battery voltage to monitor how full, or empty, your batteries are powerwise. The meter also comes in handy for various other checking and monitoring chores. Additional in-line meters are also nice to have, and I\\'d recommend them if you can swing it. An analog amp meter (to monitor your power use) is about $20, and simple volt meters (analog, digital or LED) can be purchased for $20-$60. You can buy new meters, or maybe even used meters, from most alternative energy dealers. Or check out used units from Fair Radio Sales, PO Box 1105, Lima, OH 45820. Put your meters where they can be easily seen-not only for regular monitoring purposes, but for the meter reading mania that comes over folks with home power systems. The all important wire Wire is an essential, important, and sometimes overlooked part of the system. Twelve volt systems require larger wire than 110 volt. There are plenty of wire charts around, and articles in Home Power and catalogs can help you decide the size and wire to use. The main considerations are distance from one component to another, system voltage, and amount of amperage running through the wire. Whoever you buy your components from will be able to help you with this (if not, go elsewhere). For our simple system, we\\'re going to put the panels within 40 feet of the batteries. We will size the wire to handle our anticipated future system of two modules (total of nine amps). So, 80 feet of 8 USE wire at about $50 should do us. This wire will connect the panels to the battery. Battery interconnects (to connect the two 6 volt batteries together to form a 12 volt battery) can be two gauge, two cables for $15. For this system, lighter cables would do, but for the price we might as well go with the heavier wire and be prepared for future upgrades. You will also need appropriately sized wire from the battery to the loads (such as lights and radio). Now, there isn\\'t much chance of overcharging your 220 amp hour battery bank with one 4.5 amp module if you\\'re using the power now and then, and monitoring it regularly. But if you\\'ll be leaving the system for some time without using or monitoring it, then you\\'ll want a charge controller to prevent the PV module from overcharging your battery. This gets more important as you add panels (and add additional charging capacity). A 4.5 amp charge controller is about $35, a 12 amp charge controller (large enough for two modules) is about $110. What will this system do? So what can you run with one or two PV modules? That depends on your use. You can get a whole lot more hours of lighting if you use efficient lights and turn them off when not in use, than if you have incandescent bulbs on all over the place. There is a very direct cause and effect here. A closet or pantry light that gets turned on and off often, but runs briefly, can be a low wattage incandescent light. A light that is on for an hour or more at a time should be a fluorescent or compact fluorescent. Lights needed for only minimal illumination such as an entryway or hallway can be very small amperage bulbs. Don\\'t use any more light than you need, and put it where you are going to use it. And, of course, turn it off when it\\'s not needed. This goes for any and all electric appliances. Conservation is the most important part of the alternative energy system, or any energy system for that matter. If you don\\'t use it, it doesn\\'t have to be produced or transported in the first place. So spend some time looking closely at your electrical use, and how you can reduce it. To give you an idea, we lived for 10 years on two panels (older 2.2 amp models), running lights, radio/tape player, computer, printer, and small tools. For many years we simply reduced our use in the short-sun days of winter and went back to candles and kerosene lamps for lighting. In the summer we had more than enough power. At some point we purchased a gasoline generator to run the washer and power tools. It also anemically served as a backup battery charger in the winter. Then Steve made his own, much better, gasoline battery charger using an old car alternator and the engine from our tiller. Several years later, we added two more used panels (of the same old model) so we then had about 8.8 amps of charging power in full sun. Our use also went up as we switched to run almost everything from the batteries. In the summer, we still had plenty of power from our PV panels, but we continued to use our backup generator to charge up the batteries in the winter or during extensive cloudy weather. Eventually we ended up with 14 panels, all of the older 32 to 35 watt size, with a 1200 watt battery bank and a large inverter. And our use grew as our system did. We still have extra power in the summer, but usually have to use the gas generator several times in November and December to help charge the batteries. Inverters Which brings us to another option that you will want to consider for this system (the options are almost endless!). So far we\\'ve been talking about a simple 12 volt system. That means all of your lighting, tools, and appliances will need to be 12 volt. Unfortunately, 12 volt lights are more expensive than 110 volt, and the tools and appliances are often inferior as well as more expensive. We ran for years on 12 volt power, as have many other people. It is simple and straightforward, running lights, radio, computer, washer and flour grinder. But if you want to run 110 volt appliances and lighting, you will need an inverter to change the 12 volt DC power of the battery into the 120 volt AC power that those appliances require. The downside is that it is one more piece of equipment to buy and be dependent upon, but today\\'s inverters are reliable enough to make this a reasonable option. We eventually switched everything in our house and shop to run off the inverter except for a few 12 volt lights and the flour grinder. For most home power use you will want at least a modified square wave inverter. There are many brands, and they all have their pros and cons and loyal users. Check out Home Power\\'s reviews, talk with folks involved in the industry, and ask around for other\\'s experiences. Intended use and price will probably dictate which one you will want, as they are all readily available. They come in all sizes and shapes. You can run your whole system on an inverter, thereby being able to use commonly available appliances and smaller wiring. Or you can run a mainly 12 volt system, using your inverter just for specific uses. We started with a venerable old (and noisy) 250 watt square wave TrippLite, but when the new small, inexpensive modified square wave inverters became available, we were happy to change to a 100 watt Statpower unit for computer, printers and small power tools. Then we made it to a 1300 watt PowerStar inverter to run vacuum, sewing machine and larger power tools. When we got a laser printer, we had to add a 500 watt pure sine wave ExelTech. Some things, like the laser printer, don\\'t like modified sine wave so require pure sine wave inverters. Now we have a sine wave Trace 2500 that runs just about everything. But we still have and use the old Statpower 100 and PowerStar 1300. But do remember, an inverter does not produce more power, it just helps you use it. A Trace 2500 when we only had 2 or 4 PV modules would have been rather pointless. We simply didn\\'t have enough charging capacity then and would have had to run the gas generator to charge the batteries to use the inverter to run the equipment. Better to just run those tools directly from the gasoline generator until you get more PV charging capacity. But back to the realities of our small system. We\\'re running a basic 12 volt operation, but will add a small inverter for small 110 volt use. You can get a good 100 to 250 watt inverter for $80 to $150. Inverters in the 400 to 800 watt range are around $100 to $300. Check your 110 volt power use requirements (read the labels) and size your inverter accordingly. Labeling Labeling-an extra, important, touch for your system. Do a lot of it. Make it easy. Make it readable. Do it for someone who has no idea what your system is all about. Assume that someday, someone else will need to walk into your home and be able to figure out your electrical system. And, of course, think it through and err on the margin of safety. Make sure everyone in the family understands at least the basics of the system, and how to run it. Cost and availability Total cost of the one module Homestead System, assuming you are doing the work yourself, might be about $700. Where can you get the equipment and more information? I\\'ve already mentioned Home Power magazine, and COUNTRYSIDE articles, of course. Check out local sources. Ask around. Many small dealers are on limited advertising budgets so you may have to do some legwork to ferret them out. Search out other users and ask where they purchased their equipment and their experiences. Mail order and Internet suppliers are numerous. Send for catalogs, talk with them. Find a dealer who you are comfortable with, whether local or long-distance, and stick with them. When you honestly add up the prices for the same components, including shipping and handling, you\\'ll find little difference in the total price of a system among most dealers. A big consideration is service. This can be far and away more important than price. If you need help, you want to have someone who is willing and able to give you needed advice. As is true with any purchase, when it comes time to buy, it is up to us to decide who we want to support. Another great source for A. E. information are the many regional energy fairs being held throughout the country. The largest is the Midwest Renewable Energy Fair in Custer, Wisconsin. Held the Summer Solstice weekend, this is a three day affair packed to overflowing with workshops, displays and events (and people!). There are many such events now across the country. The important thing is to get started however you can, and have a good time doing it. If you are already hooked into the grid, consider putting one small circuit on your own PV system. You\\'ll have lights and radio when the rest of your neighborhood is blacked out. You\\'ll be able to feel good about the source of that power. If you are running now from a gasoline or propane generator, think how great it would be to turn on a light or listen to the radio without that generator guzzling fuel and hammering away in the background. If you\\'re running a \"roving battery\" system, I don\\'t need to tell you how great it would be not to have to move that battery again. PV power is not costless, but it is quiet. And it is available to anyone who wants to go that extra step to install a renewable energy, photovoltaic solar system. It will make you aware of the sun in a whole new way. The photovoltaic cell These silicon wafers are the heart of a solar panel. Semiconducting cells convert sunlight into electrical energy through the photovoltaic process, hence the name. Like computer chips, the silicon in solar cells is made from highly refined sand. The wafers are layered with boron and phosphorus atoms before a metal coating is applied. The top side of the cell is painted with anti-reflective coating. This vastly increases the cell\\'s ability to absorb sunlight. The cells are wired together in panels or modules for increased efficiency and energy output. Photons, which are bundles of energy from the light, strike the cell and provide enough power to dislodge the positively charged boron atoms and the negatively charged phosphorus atoms. When the cell is exposed to sunlight, these imbalanced electrons flow in an effort to equalize the balance. This activity creates an electrical current, which can be transferred to a power storage unit such as a battery.']"
